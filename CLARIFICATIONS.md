# Elemental Elephants - Rules Clarifications

This document contains clarifications for game rules that have been discovered through playtesting.

## Spell Resolution

### Spells with Multiple Effects
- When a spell has multiple effects (like Stupefy: damage + cancel), each effect resolves completely before the next
- Example: Stupefy deals damage to all enemies with attack spells, THEN cancels all enemy attack spells

### Moved Spells
- **When a spell is moved to a different clash (e.g., by Gravitate), it no longer resolves in the current clash**
- The moved spell will resolve when its new clash is reached
- Moved spells do not advance in their original clash

## Conditional Effects

### "Only If Successful" Advance Effects
- Some spells (Clap, Enfeeble) only advance if their main effect succeeded
- Clap: Only advances friendly spells if it cancelled at least one enemy spell
- Enfeeble: Only advances if it dealt damage to at least one enemy

### Response Spells
- Response spells can "see" events that happened earlier in the round
- Example: Turbulence deals extra damage if any spell resolved earlier this round (even if that spell is no longer visible)

## Targeting Clarifications

### Clap's Targeting
- Clap cancels one spell from EACH enemy who has 2+ active spells
- If Enemy A has 3 spells and Enemy B has 2 spells, you choose 1 spell from A and 1 spell from B
- Enemies with only 1 spell are not affected

### Cancelled Spells
- Cancelled spells remain visible on the board (shown in grey in digital version)
- Cancelled spells are not "active" for any purpose
- Cancelled spells do not resolve or advance

## Special Spell Behaviors

### Gravitate
- Can only move spells from the CURRENT clash to a FUTURE clash
- Cannot move spells from past clashes
- You may choose which future clash to move the spell to
- Cannot be used in Clash IV (no future clashes exist)

### Illuminate
- Casting extra spells is OPTIONAL
- You may choose to cast 0, 1, or 2 spells from your hand

### Electrocute
- The effect is optional (you may choose "pass")
- You must discard your own spell FIRST to trigger the enemy discard
- If you have no spells to discard, the effect cannot be used

### Blood Spells (Offering, Ritual, Overexert)
- All Blood spell effects are optional
- You may choose "pass" to avoid the self-damage and the beneficial effect

## End of Round

### Getting a New Spell Set
- If your hand is empty at end of round, you automatically get a new spell set
- If you discard your entire hand during the keep/discard phase, you may draft a new spell set
- **IMPORTANT**: When you draft a new spell set at end of round:
  - You cannot discard any cards from that new set
  - You must recall cards from your discard pile until your hand is full

## Resolution Order

### Accelerator
- Makes your other spells resolve 2 priority steps faster (minimum priority 1)
- Does not speed up itself

### Same Priority
- If you control multiple spells with the same priority, you choose their resolution order

## Protection Effects

### Root
- Protects your other spells in the same clash from being cancelled, recalled, or discarded by enemies
- Does not protect itself

## Advance Phase Limits

### Self-Advancing Spells
- Some spells can only advance themselves once per round
- Examples: Repeater, Slumber, Nightglow, Break, Starfall

### Break
- While active, prevents ALL enemy spells from advancing
- Your own spells can still advance normally
