[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 4 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Opening with Reinforce (P2 Metal Remedy) is a strong proactive play for several reasons: 1) Early bolster effect permanently increases our max HP, giving long-term value 2) P2 priority means it resolves before most attacks/responses, ensuring the bolster takes effect 3) Metal element suggests opponent may have drafted aggressive cards - higher max HP helps defend against that 4) Keeps our Venom cards for when we can better leverage their advance effects in later clashes/rounds
  Clash 2: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: This is a critical defensive position that requires immediate healing. With only 3 HP and facing an opponent at 5 HP, I need to stabilize my health pool. Defend (P3) is the optimal choice because: 1) It heals for 1, bringing me to 4 HP which is safer against potential burst damage, 2) It has advance effects that can provide continued value, 3) It synergizes with my active Reinforce spell, showing good Metal element consistency. The enemy's Crepuscule is concerning, but building defensive momentum is key right now. The other options like Agonize or Enfeeble would push damage, but I'm not in a position to race - I need to shore up my defenses first.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Encumber (P2) is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At 3 HP, we need to be defensive and our active Reinforce/Defend combo will help sustain us. 2) Encumber's P2 priority lets us act before most attacks, potentially disrupting the opponent's strategy. 3) The advance effects will give us continued pressure next clash. 4) The other options (Agonize, Enfeeble, Besiege) are all attack spells which may be less effective against the opponent's Twilight setup and would resolve after their potential attacks due to lower priorities.
  Clash 4: YOU played Besiege
    Your strategy: I'll play Besiege here. While both options deal 1 damage, Besiege synergizes better with my active Metal spells (Reinforce and Defend). The enemy is at 5 HP with Twilight/Shadow spells active, suggesting they're running a control-oriented deck. My Metal package can help me weather their strategy while building board presence. Additionally, since this is the final clash of the round, Besiege's advance effects could provide value going into next round, helping me maintain pressure despite my lower HP.

  "analysis": "This opening round revealed interesting strategic dynamics from both sides. Let's analyze the key points:

STRONG ELEMENTS OF MY PLAY:
1. The Metal-heavy defensive package (Reinforce + Defend + Besiege) showed excellent synergy and established a solid defensive foundation
2. Sequencing was optimal - opening with P2 Reinforce before opponent could establish threats
3. Encumber provided disruption while maintaining defensive posture
4. Maintained card advantage by forcing opponent to react to our sustained pressure

OPPONENT'S STRONG MOVES:
1. Excellent Twilight/Shadow element synergy with Eventide/Familiar/Daybreak combination
2. Their card advantage (4 cards vs our 2) gives them strategic flexibility going into round 2
3. Clever use of Twilight's passive effects to maintain board presence

CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
- The health differential (5 vs 3) resulted from their effective pressure despite our defensive stance
- Their 4-card hand suggests they managed resources better than we did

STRATEGIC LESSONS:
1. While our Metal-based defense was solid, we may need to be more aggressive in finding damage windows
2. The opponent's Twilight/Shadow combination suggests they're running a control deck - we should prepare for a longer game
3. Card advantage will be crucial - need to maximize value from our remaining 2 cards

LOOKING AHEAD:
- Must leverage our active spells' advance effects efficiently
- Consider aggressive plays if opportunity arises, as purely defensive play may give opponent too much room to set up
- Watch for Twilight/Shadow interaction patterns to predict and counter their strategy

The opponent demonstrated strong fundamentals, but our defensive foundation gives us tools to fight back. Key to victory will be converting our defensive position into offensive pressure while maintaining resource parity."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: At 3/6 HP and significantly weakened max HP, I need to stabilize my position. Reinforce at P2 is an excellent choice here because:

1. It bolsters my max HP back up, which is critical given my weakened state
2. The P2 priority means it will resolve quickly, before most attacks
3. While Quickshot offers offensive pressure, I'm more concerned about survival right now
4. The Time boosts (Accelerator/Repeater) are powerful but risky as Conjuries when I'm at low health

This play sets me up to be more aggressive in future clashes while immediately improving my defensive position.
  Clash 2: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Selecting Accelerator (P1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 3 HP, I need to be proactive rather than reactive 2) Accelerator's P1 means it resolves before potential threats 3) Being a Time specialist, I can leverage advance effects to build momentum 4) While both Accelerator and Repeater are conjuries, Accelerator's P1 makes it harder to counter 5) The enemy's Coalesce suggests they're setting up for something - I need to disrupt their timing
  Clash 3: YOU played Repeater
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where Repeater offers the strongest strategic play. At 2 HP, I need to survive this clash and the next. The enemy has Crepuscule active which likely means more Twilight spells incoming. Repeater as a Time boost will work with my active Accelerator to potentially speed up future spells and create priority advantages. While Quickshot could deal 2 damage, it's more important to set up defenses and maintain board control. Additionally, as a Conjury, Repeater can absorb a hit if targeted, providing some protection.
  Clash 4: YOU played Quickshot
    Your strategy: Playing Quickshot (P3) is the optimal choice here. With only 2 HP remaining and the enemy at 5 HP, we need to apply pressure. While Quickshot is a Conjury and therefore vulnerable to cancellation, there are several factors that make this play strong:

1. We have Accelerator and Repeater active, which should enhance our Time magic
2. The enemy's active spells don't show any obvious cancel effects
3. Priority 3 means it will resolve before many defensive options
4. Even if countered, forcing the enemy to spend resources dealing with our threat is valuable

This play represents our best chance to deal meaningful damage before the round ends.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Reinforce (Metal)
  - YOUR Accelerator (Time)
  - YOUR Quickshot (Time)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Crepuscule (Twilight)
  - THEIR Imitate (Shadow)
  - THEIR Coalesce (Twilight)
  - THEIR Sap (Shadow)

{
  "analysis": "This round demonstrated high-level play from both sides, but ultimately my position deteriorated due to several key factors:

CRITICAL MISTAKES IN MY LINE OF PLAY:
1. The Accelerator + Repeater combo, while theoretically powerful, left me too vulnerable by committing to two Conjuries when already at low health. This allowed the opponent to maintain pressure.

2. Quickshot in clash 4 was overly aggressive - I should have prioritized survival over damage given my precarious 2 HP position.

OPPONENT'S STRONG PLAYS:
1. Excellent element synergy between Shadow and Twilight, using Crepuscule as setup for future plays
2. Smart use of Imitate to copy beneficial effects while maintaining card advantage
3. Sap was well-timed to capitalize on my weakened state

STRATEGIC LESSONS:
- When at low HP, prioritize guaranteed defensive options over risky Conjury setups
- The opponent's Shadow/Twilight combination proved more resilient than my Time-focused strategy
- Card efficiency was critical - opponent maintained hand advantage while I emptied my hand

INNOVATIVE PLAYS:
The opponent's use of Imitate showed deep understanding of copying mechanics and timing. Rather than using it reactively, they positioned it proactively to maximize value.

KEY LEARNING:
In competitive play, maintaining a healthy life total is more important than setting up elaborate combinations. My Time-based engine, while powerful, left me too exposed. Against Shadow/Twilight, I needed to play more conservatively and focus on stabilizing my position rather than trying to build momentum with vulnerable Conjuries."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: At 2 HP, I'm in a very dangerous position and need immediate healing. Defend (P3) provides crucial healing while also having advance effects for future clashes. While Break (P1) and Clap (P2) offer powerful advance effects, surviving this clash is the top priority. Stupefy could be risky without knowing the opponent's play. The Metal element of Defend may also provide favorable interactions against potential Thunder plays from the opponent.
  Clash 2: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 2 HP, we need defensive options and Break's high priority ensures it resolves before potential threats 2) Break has advance effects which provides continued value 3) Eventide is active on opponent's side, suggesting they may be setting up a big Twilight play - having Break's effects active could help counter that 4) While Clap and Stupefy are strong options, their P2 priority makes them riskier when we're at low health
  Clash 4: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Playing Stupefy here is our best option. Even though we're at low health (2/7), we have multiple protective spells active (Defend, Break, Clap) that can help us survive. The enemy has Familiar which could be dangerous, but our Thunder-based spells can help counter Shadow strategies. Most importantly, we need to maintain offensive pressure while protected to try to secure a trunk advantage.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Defend (Metal)
  - YOUR Break (Thunder)
  - YOUR Clap (Thunder)
  - YOUR Stupefy (Thunder)

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong defensive positioning and Thunder element synergy from our side, though we remain in a precarious position at 2 HP. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Defensive Layering: The sequence of Defend → Break → Clap → Stupefy created an excellent protective matrix while maintaining offensive pressure. The Metal + Thunder combination provides both immediate protection and ongoing threat.

2. Priority Management: Using Break's P1 priority was crucial, as it ensured our defensive boost would resolve before potential threats. This was especially important given our low HP situation.

OPPONENT'S PLAYS:
- Their Familiar + Repeater + Daybreak setup shows sophisticated planning, likely setting up for a major Twilight-based offensive.
- The Daybreak play suggests they may be holding Twilight spells for a finishing combination.

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
- At 2/7 HP vs their 4/5 HP, we're in danger but have strong active spells
- Our Thunder-heavy board state (Break, Clap, Stupefy) gives us excellent offensive positioning
- Their Shadow + Time + Twilight combination suggests they're planning a complex finishing sequence

KEY LEARNING:
The opponent's element diversity (Shadow/Time/Twilight) shows strong draft planning. While our Thunder-focus is powerful, we need to be wary of potential element-based counterplays in the next round.

NEXT ROUND CONSIDERATIONS:
- We must maintain defensive positioning while looking for opportunities to pressure their remaining trunks
- Their single card in hand could be a crucial Twilight spell - we need to play around potential finishing combinations
- Our active spells provide good protection, but we can't afford to be purely defensive at 2 HP"

OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires immediate action. At 2/7 HP, I'm extremely vulnerable. Overexert at P1 is the optimal play here because:
1. Fastest priority (P1) gives me initiative
2. Blood magic suggests opponent likely has limited defensive options
3. Can potentially close out a trunk before opponent can respond
4. Lower health pools in Round 4 make P1 damage extremely threatening
5. Holding Ritual and Encumber provides strong follow-up options depending on opponent's response

  "analysis": "This has been a fascinating endgame situation that demonstrates the importance of priority management and health thresholds. Let's break it down:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Health Management: We're at 6/6 HP with 2 trunks while opponent is at 4/5 HP with 3 trunks. This puts us in a precarious position where we can't afford mistakes.

2. Card Advantage: Our single card vs opponent's 3 cards puts us at a significant disadvantage. Each play must be extremely impactful.

3. Active Spells: Opponent's Crepuscule (Twilight) suggests they're setting up for a longer-term strategy, which is concerning given their card advantage.

Critical Decision Point - Overexert Play:
- The P1 Overexert play was technically sound given our desperate position
- However, opponent's maintained trunk advantage shows they've likely been more efficient with their resources

Opponent's Superior Position:
1. Card Advantage (3:1): Gives them significantly more options
2. Trunk Lead (3:2): More room for aggressive plays
3. Active Twilight: Provides ongoing value

Learning Points:
1. Earlier resource management was likely suboptimal on our part, leading to this card disadvantage
2. Opponent has shown excellent resource conservation while maintaining pressure
3. The Twilight setup shows forward-thinking strategy rather than just reactive plays

The opponent has demonstrated superior long-term planning and resource management. While our individual plays like Overexert were tactically sound, the strategic position suggests we need to improve our early-game resource management to avoid such disadvantageous late-game scenarios."

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/3 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Opening with Break (P1 Thunder boost) is strategically sound for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves first, potentially setting up advantageous interactions with future spells 2) Being a Thunder boost spell, it can enable powerful Thunder combinations in subsequent clashes 3) The advance effects can provide ongoing value throughout the round 4) Starting conservatively with a boost rather than committing to an attack pattern gives me more flexibility to react to the opponent's strategy
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Selecting Stupefy is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Break already active, we have Thunder synergy that could be valuable. 2) At Priority 2, it's fast enough to potentially disrupt enemy plays. 3) We want to save our Venom cards (Agonize, Encumber, Enfeeble) for a more coordinated poison strategy later. 4) The enemy has Accelerator active, suggesting they may be setting up for speed-based plays - Stupefy's response effects could help counter that. 5) Clap, while also P2, is better saved for when we need its advance effects specifically.
  Clash 3: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Playing Clap (Thunder) here is optimal for several reasons: 1) At P2, it's fast enough to combine with our active Break and Stupefy for maximum Thunder synergy this clash. 2) The enemy is already at 3 HP, making them vulnerable to our Thunder combo potential. 3) The boost/advance effects from Clap will continue providing value. 4) We want to avoid using our Venom cards suboptimally - they're more valuable when we can chain their effects together in a future clash.
  Clash 4: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: With the enemy at 1 HP and multiple active Thunder spells providing advantages, Enfeeble is the safer play here. While Encumber has a better priority (P2), the enemy is likely to lose their last trunk this clash regardless due to our established board presence. Enfeeble's P4 damage provides insurance if somehow our other effects don't connect, and its advance effects could be valuable going into the next round after the enemy loses a trunk and becomes invulnerable.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful execution of Thunder-based control that successfully pressured the opponent from 5 HP down to 1 HP while maintaining board presence and hand advantage. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Opening with Break (P1) established early Thunder synergy and created a foundation for the entire round
2. The Thunder spell sequence (Break → Stupefy → Clap) demonstrated excellent priority management and spell chaining
3. Maintained card advantage, ending with 2 cards while opponent is empty-handed
4. Successfully countered opponent's Time-based strategy (Accelerator/Repeater) with faster priority spells

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Over-committed to Time setup spells (Accelerator/Repeater) without sufficient protection
2. Playing Offering (Blood) showed desperation - trading cards for temporary HP when already under pressure
3. Failed to maintain sufficient defensive options against Thunder damage
4. Empty-handed going into next round severely limits their recovery options

INNOVATIVE ASPECTS:
The decision to hold Venom cards rather than mixing them suboptimally with Thunder shows high-level strategic planning. This preserves a potential Venom chain for future rounds while maximizing current Thunder synergy.

LEARNING OPPORTUNITY:
While successful, we could have potentially achieved the same pressure with more efficiency. Encumber in clash 4 was arguably unnecessary since the opponent was already at 1 HP - this card could have been saved for future rounds.

NEXT ROUND POSITIONING:
With 2 cards in hand and opponent at 1 HP with no cards, we're extremely well positioned. The opponent will likely need to play defensively to rebuild their hand, giving us initiative in the next round."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/3 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Selecting Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 1 HP, they are likely to play defensively with heals/remedies - Break's P1 will let me respond to their plays faster in future clashes 2) Thunder element provides strong follow-up options 3) The advance effects will provide ongoing value 4) Saving Agonize/Enfeeble combo for when I can maximize their synergy 5) P1 priority gives me the most flexibility to react to opponent's likely defensive plays
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy at P2 is the optimal play here. With enemy at 1 HP and Break active, we want fast priority to secure the trunk loss. Stupefy at P2 beats most defensive options and resolves before their P3+ spells. The P3/P4 Venom options are too slow - enemy could heal or protect at P2. Additionally, Break's boost effect makes our Thunder spells more impactful.
  Clash 3: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Choosing Agonize (P3) over Enfeeble (P4) for several critical reasons: 1) The higher priority is essential when the enemy is at 1 HP - we need to secure the trunk removal before they can potentially heal or protect themselves. 2) Both cards deal 1 damage, but Agonize's P3 means it will resolve before most defensive options. 3) With Break active, our Thunder spells deal +1 damage, but that's less relevant since either card would secure the trunk here. The advance effect on Agonize could be valuable next clash while the enemy is invulnerable.
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Enfeeble is the perfect play here. The opponent is at 1 HP, and Enfeeble deals 1 damage at P4. While they have Break active (which could theoretically protect against some damage), my own Break is also active, which should ensure the damage goes through. Additionally, Enfeeble advances, which gives value if they somehow survive. Given their HP situation and my guaranteed damage, this should secure the round.

  "analysis": "Let's analyze this round from a grandmaster perspective:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Opening with Break (P1) proved masterful - it set up Thunder synergies and provided priority control that became crucial throughout the round.
2. The opponent's Shadow-heavy strategy with Imitate/Sap/Familiar showed intent to build a defensive wall, but their timing was suboptimal.

Critical Decision Points:
- Clash 2's Stupefy at P2 was particularly well-executed. It demonstrated understanding of priority windows - P2 Thunder damage with Break active meant the opponent couldn't safely deploy defensive options.
- The Agonize into Enfeeble sequence (Clashes 3-4) showed expert spell sequencing. Using P3 before P4 maintained pressure while ensuring damage would connect.

Opponent's Key Mistakes:
1. Over-investment in Shadow elements without sufficient immediate defensive value
2. Allowing their HP to drop to 1 without maintaining P1-P2 defensive options
3. Suboptimal use of Break - they needed to leverage it for protection rather than offense when at low HP

Innovative Elements:
The Break + Stupefy Thunder synergy was particularly elegant - it created a priority-based damage window that's difficult to defend against without specific P1 counters.

Learning Opportunities:
- For the opponent: When at 1 HP, prioritize immediate defensive options over long-term spell chains
- The importance of element diversity - their heavy Shadow commitment left them vulnerable to faster Thunder-based pressure

This round demonstrated the core principle of high-level Elemental Elephants: priority control combined with element synergy creates windows where damage becomes nearly unavoidable."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/4 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: With the enemy at 1/5 HP, they are extremely vulnerable and likely to play defensively with healing or protection. Clap (P2) is the perfect choice here because:

1. Its Priority 2 means it will resolve before most defensive spells (P4-5)
2. The Thunder response effect could punish defensive plays
3. The advance effect gives ongoing value if they survive
4. The other options (Ichor Conjuries) are too slow at P5 and risk being cancelled

While the Conjury options are powerful, they would resolve too late to prevent the enemy from stabilizing. Clap gives us the best chance to close out the game before they can recover.
  Clash 2: YOU played Renew
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where maximizing survival is key. With the enemy at 1 HP but having active Eventide (which can enable powerful Twilight combinations), I need to shore up my defenses. Renew is perfect here because:

1. The Bolster effect permanently increases my max HP, which persists even if I lose a trunk
2. The immediate heal gets me to 3 HP, making me more resilient against potential burst damage
3. Being a Conjury makes it vulnerable, but it's worth the risk given the defensive benefits
4. Priority 5 means it resolves late, letting me see enemy aggression first

While Shrine and Dominion offer powerful effects, they're riskier plays when I need guaranteed value. The enemy's low HP means I don't need to force aggression - I can play defensively and wait for the right moment to strike.
  Clash 3: YOU played Dominion
    Your strategy: Choosing Dominion is the optimal play here. With the enemy at just 1 HP, we need reliable damage to secure a trunk break. While both options are P5 Conjuries, Dominion's attack potential is more valuable than Shrine's utility given the current game state. Even if the enemy manages to cancel Dominion, we still have Clap and Renew active which puts us in a strong position. The enemy's Daybreak active spell doesn't directly threaten our Conjury, making this a relatively safe play.

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated masterful strategic positioning and resource management. Let's break down the key elements:

STRONG PLAYS:
1. Opening with Clap (P2) was tactically brilliant:
- Perfect priority positioning to threaten their low HP
- Thunder response effect created a lose-lose situation for defensive plays
- Advance effect generates ongoing value
- Forces opponent to respect potential damage each clash

2. Defensive pivot with Renew was well-timed:
- Increased survivability through both heal and bolster
- Created buffer against potential counterplay
- Being a Conjury was an acceptable risk given board state

3. Dominion as closer showed patience and threat assessment:
- Maintained pressure while having Clap as backup
- Even if cancelled, forced opponent to spend resources

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
The opponent's position at 5/5 HP suggests they successfully stabilized despite our pressure. This indicates they:
- Had strong defensive options ready
- Managed resources well under pressure
- Possibly outmaneuvered our Clap timing

LEARNING POINTS:
1. Consider if we could have sequenced Clap differently to prevent their stabilization
2. Track what defensive tools they revealed for future rounds
3. Having only 1 card remaining vs their 2 suggests room for improved hand management

The round overall shows high-level play from both sides, with complex priority manipulation and resource trading. The opponent demonstrated resilience, but we maintained board presence with three active spells heading into the next round."

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 2 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (Thunder P1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it gives us initiative and will resolve before any enemy actions 2) Being a boost with advance effects lets us set up future clashes while maintaining pressure 3) At 3/4 HP we need to be proactive rather than reactive 4) The enemy having 2 trunks means they're vulnerable - maintaining offensive pressure is key 5) Our other options are either too slow (Shrine P5) or more situational (Encumber/Stupefy P2s)
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Stupefy. At 1 HP, I need immediate protection and Thunder synergy with active Break. Stupefy can potentially stun the opponent while dealing damage, and its P2 priority ensures it resolves before most threats. Shrine is too slow at P5, and Encumber, while useful, doesn't provide the immediate protection needed.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Encumber. At 1 HP, I must prevent lethal damage. Encumber (P2) resolves before Quickshot and can reduce its damage. Additionally, Encumber advances to next clash, providing continued protection if needed. While Shrine offers powerful effects, as a Conjury it's too vulnerable given my low HP. The combination of Break and Stupefy with Encumber creates a strong defensive wall while maintaining pressure.

1. Opening with Break (P1) was tactically sound, establishing Thunder synergy and initiative
2. The Break → Stupefy → Encumber sequence created a powerful defensive wall while maintaining offensive pressure
3. Careful priority management ensured my spells resolved at optimal timing

OPPONENT'S NOTABLE PLAYS:
- Their Twilight-heavy strategy (Crepuscule + Eventide) showed good element synergy
- Using Quickshot demonstrated understanding of priority-based pressure
- Overexert was a calculated risk that showed aggressive intent

KEY DECISION POINTS:
The critical moment came in Clash 2 where my Stupefy provided both defense and maintained Thunder synergy from Break. This proved more valuable than holding it for later, as it forced the opponent into a defensive posture.

ENDGAME ANALYSIS:
The current position (4/4 HP vs 2/5 HP) reflects successful execution of a control strategy. With both players at 2 trunks, but me having card advantage (1 vs 0), I've established a winning position through careful resource management.

LEARNING POINTS:
- The opponent could have better sequenced their Twilight spells to maximize damage output
- Their aggressive use of Overexert without backup protection left them vulnerable
- The timing of Quickshot, while threatening, could have been better coordinated with their other spells

This round showcases how proper priority management and spell sequencing can create both offensive pressure and defensive stability simultaneously."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/3 HP, 2 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 1 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Selecting Clap (Thunder P2) for several strategic reasons: 1) With opponent at 2 HP, they're likely to play defensively with heals/remedies - Clap's P2 will resolve before most defensive options. 2) The advance effects give future value if they survive. 3) We want to save our Conjury spells since they're vulnerable to cancellation, and opponent may have responses ready given their low HP. 4) Priority 2 gives us excellent positioning to threaten lethal while staying ahead of most counters.
  Clash 2: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Enfeeble at P4 is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy is at 2 HP and we need to maintain pressure - Enfeeble's guaranteed 1 damage will put them at critical 1 HP. 2) While we have Conjury options, they're all P5 and more risky since they can be cancelled. 3) Enfeeble has advance effects that can help us in future clashes. 4) With Clap active, we want to play into its synergies rather than risk having our Conjuries cancelled.

  "analysis": "This round showcased effective pressure and strategic spell sequencing from our side. Let's analyze the key elements:

STRATEGIC SUCCESSES:
1. Priority Management
- Opening with Clap (P2) was technically sound, staying ahead of potential defensive plays
- Following with Enfeeble (P4) maintained consistent pressure while leveraging Clap's advance effects

2. Resource Efficiency  
- Avoided playing vulnerable Conjuries when ahead, denying opponent comeback potential
- Built compound pressure through advance effects from both spells

3. Board Control
- Maintained initiative while forcing opponent into reactive positions
- Successfully reduced opponent to their final trunk through calculated pressure

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
- Their position at 1 trunk shows they've been pushed into a defensive corner
- Higher HP (5/5) suggests successful healing/defensive play, but at cost of board control
- Limited to 3 cards indicates potential resource constraints

KEY LEARNING:
The round demonstrates the power of consistent pressure over high-risk plays. Rather than overcommitting with Conjuries, we used reliable damage sources that compound over time.

LOOKING AHEAD:
With opponent at 1 trunk but healthy HP, they'll likely play defensively. Our strategy should:
1. Continue pressure while watching for desperate counterplays
2. Consider how to break through potential defensive stalling
3. Maintain card advantage to outlast their remaining resources"

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/3 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 1 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Selecting Stupefy (Thunder P2) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With opponent at 5 HP and only 1 trunk, we want to maintain pressure - Stupefy's P2 gives us a fast attack that's hard to counter. 2) The P5 Conjury spells are too slow and risky in this position since they can be cancelled. 3) While Break (P1) is fast, we want to save it for potential combo plays or defensive needs. 4) Stupefy's response effects give us additional value if opponent tries certain counter-plays. 5) At 3/3 HP ourselves with 2 trunks, we're in a strong position to be aggressive rather than defensive.
  Clash 2: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Stupefy already active and Accelerator on the opponent's side, having a P1 spell gives us control over the priority sequence. 2) Break's advance effects will help set up future clashes while being fast enough to avoid disruption. 3) Most importantly, with the opponent at 1 trunk, we need to maintain pressure - the Ichor conjuries are too slow at P5 and vulnerable to being cancelled. Break provides the best tempo play while protecting our position.
  Clash 3: YOU played Shrine
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where Shrine's complex effects could be game-changing. With both players having Break active, the damage potential is high, but I'm at a health disadvantage (3 vs 5). Shrine is a strong P5 play that can help control the battlefield and potentially set up for lethal damage in the final clash. While it's vulnerable to being cancelled as a Conjury, forcing the opponent to deal with it diverts their resources. The enemy having Imitate active makes me cautious of playing Renew or Dominion, as they could be copied for greater effect by the opponent.
  Clash 4: YOU played Dominion
    Your strategy: Playing Dominion here is the optimal choice for several reasons: 1) The opponent is at 5 HP with their last trunk - we need to push for lethal damage. 2) While it's P5 and a Conjury, the opponent likely has limited options in the final clash. 3) With our Break active and their Breaks active, there's a complex Thunder interaction that could work in our favor. 4) Renew wouldn't provide enough value at this critical juncture, and Repeater being PA makes it too slow for this final clash. 5) Dominion's complex effects could provide the finishing blow we need.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Stupefy (Thunder)
  - YOUR Break (Thunder)
  - YOUR Shrine (Ichor)
  - YOUR Dominion (Ichor)

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of play from our side, demonstrating expert understanding of priority manipulation and Thunder synergies. Let's break down the key moments:

STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS:
1. Opening with Stupefy (P2) was crucial - it applied early pressure while staying ahead of their Accelerator. This forced them to respect our Thunder damage potential.

2. The double Break sequence in Clash 2 was particularly interesting. While they matched our Break play, we maintained priority advantage due to being Ringleader. This priority control proved decisive.

3. Shrine into Dominion in the final clashes was a sophisticated closing sequence. Even though they're both P5 Conjuries, the opponent was forced into defensive positions due to our established board presence.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Their Imitate (Shadow) didn't find enough value - they could have waited for a more impactful spell to copy.
2. Double Break play was questionable with only one trunk remaining - it left them vulnerable to our Thunder damage chain.
3. Impact in the final clash showed desperation - a faster priority spell might have disrupted our Dominion.

INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS:
The most impressive aspect was our Thunder priority chain. By sequencing Stupefy -> Break -> Shrine -> Dominion, we created a cascade of effects that was difficult to counter. The opponent's Life total at 5 with one trunk meant any miscalculation would be fatal.

LEARNING POINTS:
For the opponent, this game demonstrates the importance of trunk management. At one trunk, playing aggressive spells like Break becomes much riskier. They should have focused on stabilizing their position rather than matching our aggression.

Overall, this round showcased high-level elemental synergy and priority manipulation, core skills for mastering Elemental Elephants."

[SAVANT] Round 7 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 7 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 1 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Renew
    Your strategy: With 2/3 HP and a vulnerable position, Renew is the optimal defensive play. The Bolster+Heal combination will get me to 3/4 HP, providing crucial survivability. While it's a Conjury that can be cancelled, it's worth the risk since I need the health buffer. The enemy has 1 trunk left, so I want to be in a strong position to deliver the finishing blow in coming clashes. The other options are more aggressive but don't address my immediate vulnerability.
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy has Sap active, which makes this a perfect time to use Stupefy's response effect. 2) At P2, it will resolve before most slower spells, allowing us to potentially disrupt enemy plans. 3) With enemy at 1 trunk and 5 HP, we need to maintain offensive pressure - any damage we can deal brings us closer to victory. 4) The other options are less impactful - Encumber/Clap's advance effects are too slow when we need immediate impact, and Enfeeble's P4 makes it too slow for this critical moment.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At P2, it's fast enough to potentially disrupt enemy plays 2) With Renew and Stupefy already active, adding another advance effect creates powerful momentum 3) Enemy is down to their last trunk, so maintaining pressure through advance effects is crucial 4) Enemy's active Sap suggests they're playing defensively - Encumber helps maintain offensive tempo
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 3/5 HP and only 1 trunk remaining, dealing that final point of damage to force their last trunk loss is critical. While Clap has a better priority (P2 vs P4), the guaranteed 1 damage from Enfeeble is more valuable in this winning position. Additionally, Enfeeble's advance effects will carry forward, potentially setting up future advantages if the game continues.

{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and pressure that showcased high-level strategic play from both sides. Let's break it down:

  KEY STRENGTHS OF MY PLAY:
  1. The Renew opening was crucial - converting a vulnerable 2/3 HP position into a more stable 3/4 HP while increasing max health
  2. Excellent spell sequencing with Stupefy → Encumber → Enfeeble creating layered pressure
  3. Maintained constant offensive momentum while simultaneously shoring up defenses

  OPPONENT'S STRONG POINTS:
  - Skillful use of Coalesce and Daybreak shows understanding of defensive positioning
  - Their Twilight element choices suggest they're playing a control-oriented strategy
  - Managing to stay alive at 2/5 HP with just one trunk shows resilience

  CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
  1. When my Renew resolved without being cancelled - this was the foundation for everything else
  2. The Stupefy play punishing their Sap demonstrated strong tactical awareness
  3. The advance chain of Encumber/Enfeeble created sustained pressure

  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (OPPONENT):
  - Could have been more aggressive in trying to cancel my Renew Conjury
  - Letting multiple advance effects stack against them limited their options
  - May need to transition from defensive to offensive posture given their trunk disadvantage

  STRATEGIC OUTLOOK:
  With me at 3/4 HP and 2 trunks vs their 2/5 HP and 1 trunk, I've established a commanding position. The active spells favor me as well, with both Encumber and Enfeeble advancing to create continued pressure.

  This round demonstrated the importance of balancing immediate tactical needs (healing/survival) with setting up longer-term strategic advantages (advance effects). A textbook example of converting a vulnerable position into a winning one through methodical, calculated play."

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Nightglow
    Your strategy: Opening with Nightglow (P2) is a strong strategic choice for several reasons: 1) Its high priority ensures it resolves early, 2) The bolster effect provides permanent max HP increase which is valuable early game, 3) Being a Moonshine card gives flexibility for future synergies, 4) It has advance effects which can provide ongoing value. The P2 priority also lets us see how opponent plays before committing to more aggressive options.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Selecting Agonize (P3 Venom attack) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 3/6 HP, I need to maintain offensive pressure while the enemy is at 5/5 HP. 2) The P3 priority is important to ensure damage lands before potential enemy remedies at P4-5. 3) Agonize has advance effects which will provide ongoing value. 4) With Nightglow active, I have some defensive coverage if needed. The enemy's Crepuscule indicates they're running Twilight, so I need to be aggressive before they can setup their powerful late-game combinations.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber (P2) is optimal here for several reasons:
1. At 3 HP, I need to play defensively while maximizing synergy with my active Venom spells (Agonize)
2. The P2 priority lets me act before most attacks, giving better protection
3. Encumber's advance effects will continue providing value into the next clash
4. With Nightglow and Agonize already active, I have good spell momentum - adding another advancing spell maintains pressure
5. The other options (Enfeeble, Slumber, Bedim) are all slower P4/P5 which could leave me vulnerable
6. Enemy has Twilight spells active which often deal damage - the faster priority helps counter that
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Agonize and Encumber already active, adding another Venom spell maximizes synergy. 2) At P4, it will resolve before enemy remedies at P5 that could heal. 3) The 1 damage could be crucial as the enemy is at 5 HP - pushing them closer to a trunk loss. 4) The advance effect gives value next clash if we survive. Most importantly, we're at critical 3 HP - we need to focus on ending this round quickly through damage rather than trying to heal with Slumber, which would be too slow at P5.

{
  "analysis": "Let's break down this fascinating round from a grandmaster perspective:

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
1. Opening Dynamics
- My Nightglow opener was solid but ultimately got outpaced by their Twilight engine
- Opponent skillfully built their Twilight package (Crepuscule → Eventide → Daybreak → Coalesce)
- They've achieved superior board position with 4 active Twilight spells vs my 3 Venom

CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
1. Clash 2 was pivotal
- My Agonize play was aggressive but perhaps premature
- Should have anticipated their Twilight buildup and held more defensive options
- Lost significant health here which put us in a defensive posture

2. Resource Management
- Opponent maintained card advantage (3 cards vs our 2)
- They've established better HP position (4/5 vs our 3/6)
- Their Twilight engine is fully operational while our Venom synergy is just starting

OPPONENT'S STRENGTHS:
- Excellent element consistency (pure Twilight build)
- Patient buildup of synergistic effects
- Maintained card advantage throughout
- Successfully pressured our health while building their engine

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (Self):
1. Element Focus
- Mixed Moonshine (Nightglow) with Venom package reduced synergy
- Should have committed fully to one element strategy

2. Defensive Timing
- Could have sequenced defensive plays better to preserve health
- Got too aggressive with Agonize when opponent was clearly setting up

Looking ahead, we're in a challenging position. Their Twilight engine is fully operational while we're at critical health. Next round will require precise play and possibly some high-risk strategies to overcome their advantage.

This was a masterclass in Twilight engine building by our opponent - they deserve credit for their disciplined, systematic approach to establishing board control."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber with P2 priority for several strategic reasons: 1) At 3/6 HP, I need to be defensive while setting up future plays. Encumber's high priority gives me control over the clash. 2) Being a boost with advance effects, it can provide value over multiple clashes. 3) The opponent at 4/5 HP isn't in immediate danger, so rushing damage isn't crucial. 4) Having multiple Venom cards (Agonize, Enfeeble) suggests potential synergies I can set up with Encumber's effects for later clashes.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Selecting Agonize (P3) for several strategic reasons: 1) With Break active, the opponent likely wants to advance aggressive spells - Agonize's P3 lets me potentially disrupt before their main damage comes in. 2) At 3 HP, healing for 1 with Slumber isn't as valuable as maintaining offensive pressure. 3) With Encumber already active and another Venom spell, we can start building powerful venom synergies. 4) Agonize's advance effects give future value while keeping pressure. 5) Enfeeble at P4 would be too slow given the likely incoming aggression.
  Clash 3: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P4, it will resolve before their active Break and Clap effects, 2) The 1 damage could be crucial with enemy at 4 HP, 3) It synergizes with our active Venom spells Encumber and Agonize, strengthening our Venom-based strategy, 4) The advance effects will help maintain pressure into the final clash, and 5) While Slumber's healing is tempting at 3 HP, playing defensively now would waste our established offensive momentum with Venom effects.
  Clash 4: YOU played Slumber
    Your strategy: Playing Slumber here is critical for survival. At 1 HP, I absolutely need the heal to avoid losing a trunk. While Slumber is slow at P5, the enemy's active spells don't seem to include direct damage that would threaten me before it resolves. Additionally, Slumber's advance effect could provide value in future clashes of the next round.

  "analysis": "This was a fascinating round that demonstrated both strong strategic play and some key areas for improvement from both sides.

OPPONENT'S STRONG PLAYS:
- Excellent Thunder chain with Break → Clap → Stupefy showing forward planning
- Break in Clash 1 was well-timed to enable their subsequent Thunder combo
- Using Nightglow in final clash was smart to maintain pressure while advancing effects

MY EXECUTION:
- Successfully established a powerful triple-Venom engine (Encumber, Agonize, Enfeeble)
- Used priority effectively, especially P2 Encumber to get ahead of opponent's setup
- However, I made a critical error in Clash 3 that nearly cost me:
  * Playing Enfeeble at P4 was too greedy
  * Should have played Slumber then to stabilize HP earlier
  * This forced a desperate Slumber in Clash 4 at low HP

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. While my Venom strategy was strong, I prioritized offense over survival
2. The opponent's Thunder chain showed excellent spell sequencing
3. HP management is crucial - dropping to 2 HP was dangerous and preventable

The most interesting aspect was the clash of strategies:
- My Venom-based control approach vs their Thunder burst damage
- Both strategies were valid, but execution timing was key
- The round ended with both of us at relatively low HP, showing the effectiveness of both approaches

For improvement:
- I need to better balance aggression with survival
- Opponent could have potentially saved one Thunder spell for next round's setup
- Both of us ended with empty hands, suggesting room for better resource management

A technically complex round that showcased high-level strategy while highlighting the importance of timing and HP management."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Cleanse
    Your strategy: Choosing Cleanse is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 2/6 HP I need healing, but also need to apply pressure. Cleanse offers both healing and potential damage. 2) Priority 3 gives me good timing to both heal and potentially deal damage before slower spells. 3) Keeping Flow and Nourish gives me strong healing options for later clashes when needed. 4) With opponent at 4/6 HP, maintaining offensive pressure while stabilizing my health is key to turning this round around.
  Clash 2: YOU played Nourish
    Your strategy: In this critical position at 3/6 HP, Nourish is the optimal play for several reasons: 1) We need immediate healing to avoid trunk loss, and Nourish provides the most efficient healing (2 HP) 2) While Flow also heals, its advance effects are less valuable when we're in survival mode 3) Bedim's damage is too slow at P4 and doesn't help our defensive needs 4) We already have Cleanse active which could provide additional healing, so stacking healing effects maximizes our chance of stabilizing
  Clash 3: YOU played Flow
    Your strategy: Flow is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority will resolve before the enemy's Absorb, ensuring I get value from the heal 2) It synergizes with my active Water spells (Cleanse and Nourish), potentially setting up powerful combinations 3) The advance effect provides ongoing value 4) With both players at relatively high health, focusing on board control and spell synergy is more important than the minor damage from Bedim
  Clash 4: YOU played Bedim
    Your strategy: Playing Bedim (P4) is the optimal choice here. With both players at low health, damage potential is crucial. While Bedim only deals 1 damage, it can advance to keep pressure next round. More importantly, my active Flow spell suggests I'm running a Water-focused strategy, and maintaining board presence helps enable future Water synergies. The enemy's Crepuscule and Absorb show they're trying to stabilize through healing, so maintaining offensive pressure is key. Even if they heal, carrying Bedim forward creates future opportunities.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Cleanse (Water)
  - YOUR Nourish (Water)
  - YOUR Flow (Water)
  - YOUR Bedim (Moonshine)

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong technical play from both sides, but revealed some key strategic insights:

OPPONENT'S STRONG POINTS:
- Excellent defensive timing with Absorb and Crepuscule to stabilize their position
- Smart resource management keeping their health above critical thresholds
- Good element synergy between Nectar and Twilight effects

MY ADVANTAGES:
- Superior water synergy package with Cleanse/Nourish/Flow creating a powerful engine
- Better priority control through P3 spells allowing me to resolve key effects first
- More forward-looking strategy with advancing effects from Flow and Bedim

CRITICAL MOMENTS:
1. My early Cleanse play was crucial - it provided both healing and potential damage while enabling water synergies
2. The opponent's Absorb timing was slightly suboptimal - playing it after my P3 Flow meant they got less value
3. My triple Water spell sequence created strong board presence while maintaining health

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Water-heavy strategies excel at sustained pressure while maintaining health
- Priority manipulation is crucial - winning P3 vs P4 battles consistently generates advantage
- Advance effects become more valuable in drawn-out rounds

The round ended fairly evenly with both players at moderate health, but I believe I have a slight strategic advantage going into next round due to:
1. More active spells (4 vs 2)
2. Better element synergy
3. More advance potential

A masterclass in resource management and spell timing from both sides, though the opponent could improve their priority sequencing to better counter Water strategies."

[SAVANT] Round 4 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 4 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber is optimal here for several reasons: 1) It has the highest priority (P2) among our options, giving us initiative 2) As a response/boost with advance effects, it can provide defensive utility while setting up future clashes 3) At 3 HP, we need to play defensively while looking for opportunities to turn the game 4) Having Starfall in reserve gives us offensive options if an opening presents itself
  Clash 2: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Selecting Starfall is optimal here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority ensures it resolves before most defensive options 2) The 1 damage helps pressure their remaining HP 3) Being an Aster spell with advance effects positions us well for future clashes 4) With Encumber active, we want to maintain offensive pressure while they potentially have reduced options. Constellation is too risky as a Conjury that could be cancelled, while Gleam's PA priority makes it too slow for our current needs.
  Clash 3: YOU played Constellation
    Your strategy: Playing Constellation (P5) is the optimal choice here. With both players at low health and my Starfall already active, I need to maximize defensive positioning. While Gleam could advance, Constellation as a Conjury provides better strategic value. Even if it gets cancelled, it forces the opponent to commit resources to deal with it. If it survives, its advance effects will help control the final clash positioning. The enemy's Turbulence and Eventide suggest they're setting up for a final clash push, so establishing a strong defensive presence now is crucial.
  Clash 4: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Playing Starfall is the optimal choice in this critical endgame scenario. With both players at 2 HP and 3 trunks, this clash could decide the game. Starfall's P3 attack will resolve before the enemy's Turbulence (Wind response) and Blow (Wind basic). The 1 damage from Starfall is enough to reduce the opponent to 1 HP, and if they don't have healing, they'll be extremely vulnerable next round. Additionally, Starfall synergizes with our active Constellation boost, potentially setting up powerful advance effects for future plays.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and priority manipulation. Let's break down the key moments:

  STRONG PLAYS:
  1. Opening with Encumber (P2) was tactically sound, forcing opponent response and setting tempo
  2. Following up with Starfall demonstrated excellent priority management - P3 attack that advanced perfectly
  3. Using Constellation despite its vulnerability showed advanced risk assessment - opponent had to choose between cancelling it or dealing with Starfall

  OPPONENT'S DECISIONS:
  - Their Wind/Twilight combination (Turbulence + Eventide) suggests they're setting up for a powerful Round 5
  - However, they may have committed too heavily to future positioning while neglecting immediate threats
  - Letting Constellation resolve without cancellation was questionable - this could prove costly

  We've achieved a strong board state:
  - Both players at 2 HP, but we have active Constellation + Starfall
  - Their Wind spells are typically reactive, giving us initiative
  - Eventide suggests they lack immediate damage options

  KEY LEARNING:
  The opponent's focus on Wind/Twilight synergy is strategically sound, but their timing left them vulnerable. In Elemental Elephants, sometimes you must sacrifice perfect spell combinations to address immediate threats.

  Looking ahead to Round 5, we have established priority advantage and multiple active effects. The opponent will need exceptional card quality to overcome this position."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/6 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Scorch
    Your strategy: With both players at 2 HP and 3 trunks, this is an extremely critical clash. Scorch is the optimal play here because it offers the most versatile damage output while having potential advance effects. While Agonize has better priority (P3), dealing 1 damage isn't enough to secure the trunk. Fireball is too straightforward, and Ignite's 1 damage is insufficient. Scorch gives us the best chance of securing lethal damage while potentially setting up future clashes if the opponent survives.

OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Reflect (Sunbeam)

  "analysis": "This was a masterful endgame sequence that demonstrated strong fundamentals. Let's analyze the key aspects:

STRATEGIC ELEMENTS:
1. Our Scorch play was optimal given the situation:
   - At 2 HP vs 2 HP, every point of damage was critical
   - P3 priority meant it would resolve before most defensive options
   - The 2 damage output was exactly what we needed
   - Advance potential provided insurance if it didn't end the game

2. Opponent's Reflect was a solid defensive read:
   - They correctly anticipated a damage spell
   - P2 priority would protect against most attacks
   - However, they made a critical error choosing Reflect over other defensive options

KEY MISTAKE BY OPPONENT:
The opponent's choice of Reflect reveals inexperience with priority interactions. While Reflect is P2, it only works against P3 or slower spells. Against equal or faster priority spells, it fails to protect. A more experienced player might have:
- Used a P1 defensive spell if available
- Held multiple defensive options
- Positioned differently to avoid lethal damage

LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Priority mastery is essential in high-stakes situations
2. Understanding exact spell interactions can decide games
3. Having backup plans is crucial when defending lethal

The game state (6/6 HP vs 1/6 HP with trunk differential) shows we've established clear dominance through superior resource management and priority control. Our opponent needs to improve their understanding of defensive timing windows to compete at this level."

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 2/3 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Opening with Overexert (P1) is a powerful play for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent can play, guaranteeing its effect 2) It can set up strong follow-up plays with my Blood and Venom cards 3) The opponent likely won't expect such an aggressive opening, potentially disrupting their planned sequence 4) Having multiple Venom advance effects in hand (Agonize, Encumber, Enfeeble) means I can build pressure over subsequent clashes even if I take some early damage
  Clash 2: YOU played Ritual
    Your strategy: Playing Ritual (P3) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority lets it resolve before the enemy's likely P4-P5 plays, synergizing with our active Agonize and Encumber. 2) The advance effects will help maintain pressure in future clashes. 3) With Blood element synergy from active Overexert, this creates a powerful offensive sequence. 4) Enfeeble would be slower at P4, and Offering's self-damage is risky when we're already at 4/5 HP.
  Clash 3: YOU played Offering
    Your strategy: Critical situation at 1 HP requires maximizing survival and damage potential. Offering is the superior choice here because:
1. With Ritual active, Offering will deal significant damage and potentially secure a trunk break
2. Enfeeble, while good, would be less impactful given our existing Venom stack
3. The enemy's Quickshot is concerning but we need to press our advantage while we have the Blood synergy active

  "analysis": "This was an excellent opening round that demonstrated high-level strategic play from both sides, though our aggressive sequence proved superior. Let's break it down:

KEY ADVANTAGES SECURED:
1. Trunk advantage gained (opponent down to 2/3 HP)
2. Card advantage (opponent forced to use more resources)
3. Successfully executed a 3-clash Blood/Venom combo sequence

CRITICAL DECISION POINTS:

Our Opening (Overexert):
- The P1 priority opening was crucial, establishing Blood synergy
- Taking calculated early damage (5→4 HP) enabled powerful follow-ups
- Opponent likely expected a more conservative opener, giving us initiative

Mid-Round Pivot (Ritual):
- Perfect timing at P3, threading between typical defensive responses
- Blood synergy amplified damage potential
- Advance effects maintained pressure through later clashes

OPPONENT'S KEY MISTAKES:
1. Quickshot timing was suboptimal - should have played it earlier to contest our Ritual
2. Familiar provided insufficient defensive coverage against our multi-element assault
3. Card sequencing revealed their hand too early, allowing us to play around their options

LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:
- Opponent should consider holding Time spells for counter-timing
- Shadow defensive plays need better synchronization with offensive sequences
- Early trunk preservation sometimes matters more than card advantage

The most impressive aspect was our ability to convert a 1-card hand into a trunk advantage through precise priority sequencing. Moving forward, we should watch for Time-based counterplay as the opponent likely has answers to this strategy in their deck."

YOUR STATUS: 4/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Selecting Overexert (Blood, P1) is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 2/3 HP and me having priority advantage, a P1 spell gives the best chance to secure a trunk break before they can respond. Blood spells tend to have powerful immediate effects, and Overexert's P1 timing ensures it resolves first. The enemy's low health makes them vulnerable, and acting before they can heal or defend is crucial. While the Venom options offer interesting advance effects, the immediate pressure from a P1 Blood spell is more valuable in this position.
  Clash 2: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Playing Encumber (P2) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 1 HP and multiple Venom responses active (Enfeeble, Agonize), adding another Venom response maximizes damage potential if they play certain spell types. 2) The P2 priority ensures it resolves before most other spells, potentially affecting enemy plays. 3) The advance effect provides continued value in future clashes. 4) Most importantly, we want to maintain pressure while they're at critical HP - Ritual would be too slow at P3 and might give them room to recover.

  "analysis": "Let's break down Round 2's strategic dynamics:

  STRONG POINTS:
  - The P1 Overexert play was perfectly timed, applying critical pressure when opponent was vulnerable
  - Building a triple Venom response suite (Enfeeble, Agonize, Encumber) created a powerful defensive wall
  - Priority sequencing was optimal, using P1/P2 spells to maintain tempo
  
  OPPONENT MISTAKES:
  1. Failed to adequately protect against Blood damage, leaving themselves exposed to Overexert
  2. Allowed multiple Venom responses to stack, creating a dangerous response matrix
  3. Card efficiency issues - ending with 2 cards while we have active spells suggests suboptimal plays

  KEY LEARNING:
  The round showcases the power of priority control and element stacking. By building multiple Venom responses while maintaining Blood pressure, we created a 'lose-lose' situation for the opponent. If they play aggressively, Venom responses punish them. If they play defensively, they risk getting overwhelmed by direct damage.

  STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHT:
  The Encumber play in Clash 2 was particularly strong - not only did it add to our Venom response suite, but its P2 priority meant it could interact with enemy plays before they resolved. This type of priority-based control is a hallmark of high-level play.

  The opponent needs to improve their defensive timing and element diversity to counter such strategies in future rounds."

  "analysis": "This has become a critical position that demonstrates the importance of trunk management and health thresholds. Let's analyze the key aspects:

  POSITION ASSESSMENT:
  - We're at 1 trunk vs opponent's 2 trunks, putting us at a disadvantage
  - However, our 5/5 HP vs their 2/2 HP gives us a significant health advantage
  - Their active Quickshot indicates they're likely running a Time-based strategy
  
  KEY DECISION POINTS FROM ROUND 3:
  1. Our Overexert play was technically sound but perhaps too conservative given the trunk differential. We could have pursued a more aggressive line to pressure their remaining 2/2 HP.
  
  2. The opponent maintaining 4 cards while we're down to 2 suggests they've managed their resources better. This card advantage could become crucial in the final round.

  STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
  - The opponent's 2/2 HP means they're vulnerable to any 2+ damage play
  - However, their 4-card hand suggests they likely have defensive options
  - Our limited 2-card hand means we need to maximize value from each play

  LEARNING POINTS:
  1. The opponent has demonstrated good resource management by maintaining a larger hand
  2. They've effectively used their Time element to maintain board presence with Quickshot
  3. We could have been more aggressive earlier to capitalize on our health advantage

  This is a textbook example of how trunk advantage can offset a health disadvantage, forcing the player with more HP but fewer trunks to find lethal before running out of resources."

YOUR STATUS: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (Thunder P1) is optimal for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent can play, giving us initiative 2) Thunder spells tend to be aggressive, and establishing early pressure is key 3) Having advance effects means it can continue providing value beyond this clash 4) It protects our P1 slot while keeping Clap and Stupefy as strong P2 responses for later clashes 5) We avoid playing our Conjury (Crepuscule) early when it's most vulnerable to cancellation
  Clash 2: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Daybreak is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) It's Priority 1, which means it will resolve before the enemy's spell and my active Break spell, 2) Having Break active makes Daybreak particularly potent as they can combo together, 3) The early clash positioning allows me to potentially set up future Twilight synergies, and 4) I want to maintain pressure while I have board advantage with Break active. Daybreak's fast Priority 1 timing ensures I can execute my strategy before the opponent can respond.
  Clash 4: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Coalesce is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P1, it resolves before enemy Quickshot, allowing me to potentially protect myself 2) With Break and Daybreak already active, Coalesce's synergy with other Twilight spells could provide significant value 3) With advance effects, it can carry forward momentum into next round 4) Being at 4/5 HP means I need to prioritize protection against the incoming Quickshot damage

  "analysis": "Let's break down this fascinating round from a grandmaster perspective:

STRONG POINTS IN OUR PLAY:
1. Excellent Priority Control: Our sequence of P1 spells (Break → Daybreak → Coalesce) demonstrated masterful priority manipulation, consistently acting before opponent
2. Element Synergy: Building a strong Twilight package while using Thunder for early pressure
3. Forward Momentum: Multiple advance effects position us well for next round

OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
1. Time Element Timing: Their Repeater/Quickshot combination came too late to prevent our setup
2. Resource Management: Ending with only 2 cards while we have 3 suggests suboptimal hand efficiency
3. Defensive Gaps: Failed to prevent our P1 spell chain, allowing us to establish board control

KEY TURNING POINTS:
- Break into Daybreak sequence was particularly strong, as it established both pressure and board presence
- Opponent's Encumber (Venom) shows they recognized the threat but couldn't effectively counter our priority advantage
- Our Coalesce play skillfully protected against their Quickshot while maintaining our strategy

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
- We've established a strong Twilight presence which threatens powerful combinations next round
- Opponent's Time element suggests they'll try to regain tempo - we should prepare for acceleration effects
- Our 4/5 HP is acceptable given our board position and card advantage

AREAS TO WATCH:
1. Opponent still has 5/5 HP - we need to convert our board advantage into damage
2. Their remaining 2 cards could be powerful responses - maintain flexibility
3. Time/Venom combination suggests they might pivot to a control strategy

Overall, we've executed a superior opening strategy, but must remain vigilant as Time/Venom combinations can enable powerful comebacks if we get overconfident."

YOUR STATUS: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Playing Accelerator (Time P1 Conjury) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves first which is crucial for setting up tempo advantage 2) While it's vulnerable as a Conjury, the potential payoff of its advance effects is worth the risk 3) With both players at relatively high health, this is a good time to establish board presence rather than going for direct damage 4) Holding Stupefy and Clap gives us strong response options for later clashes, especially if the opponent tries to punish our Conjury setup
  Clash 2: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Selecting Clap here is optimal for several reasons: 1) With Accelerator active, I'm in a strong position to leverage advance effects. 2) The P2 priority matches Quickshot, and as Ringleader I'll resolve first, potentially disrupting their strategy. 3) Stupefy and Eventide, while powerful, don't synergize as well with my current board state and the advance potential Clap provides. 4) At 3/5 HP, I need to be proactive rather than reactive, and Clap's advance effects can help me maintain pressure.
  Clash 3: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy is the optimal play here for several key reasons: 1) With the same P2 priority as enemy's active Quickshot, I'll get to act first due to turn order advantage. 2) Stupefy's response effect can capitalize on the enemy's active spells. 3) The Thunder synergy with my active Clap spell could create a powerful combination. 4) At 3 HP, I need to maintain pressure rather than setting up with Eventide's boost effects.
  Clash 4: YOU played Eventide
    Your strategy: Playing Eventide here is the optimal choice for several reasons: 1) With both players at 3 HP and 3 trunks, we're in a critical position where trunk loss is imminent. 2) We already have Accelerator and Clap as active boosts, and Eventide's complex effects can potentially stack with these for maximum impact. 3) The P2 priority means it will resolve before most attacks, giving us tactical advantage. 4) The enemy's Quickshot is concerning, but our combination of active spells plus Eventide gives us the best chance to survive and potentially turn the situation in our favor.

  "analysis": "This was a masterfully played round that showcased high-level strategic positioning and spell sequencing. Let's break down the key elements:

  STRENGTHS OF OUR PLAY:
  1. Opening with Accelerator (P1) was crucial - it established board presence and created advance opportunities that would pay dividends throughout the round
  2. The Clap + Stupefy thunder synergy was well-timed and demonstrated excellent elemental awareness
  3. Our priority sequencing was impeccable - consistently leveraging Ringleader advantage to resolve before opponent's same-priority spells

  OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
  1. Their lone Quickshot, while a strong spell, left them vulnerable without supporting pieces
  2. They failed to protect against or punish our Conjury setup, missing a key opportunity to disrupt our strategy
  3. The lack of active spells suggests they may have over-committed to immediate effects rather than building board presence

  CRITICAL DECISION POINT:
  The final clash Eventide play was particularly sophisticated - it layered another complex effect onto our already strong board state while maintaining P2 priority. This demonstrates mastery of the 'stack and leverage' strategy that defines high-level play.

  LOOKING AHEAD:
  With both players at 3 HP, the next round will likely be decisive. Our superior board presence (4 active spells vs 1) gives us a significant advantage, but trunk loss mechanics mean we can't become overconfident.

  KEY LEARNING:
  This round perfectly illustrates why board development and spell synergy often trump pure damage racing in high-level play. The opponent's more direct approach left them without the tools to counter our sophisticated spell matrix."

YOUR STATUS: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At P1, it resolves before most spells, letting me see the opponent's play before committing to my advance effects 2) Both players are at 3/5 HP - a critical threshold where advance effects could be lethal 3) Having Gleam and Starfall as follow-up options gives me strong advance chains for the next clashes 4) Break's Thunder boost effects could help protect against common Round 3 burst damage patterns
  Clash 2: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Starfall is the optimal play here for multiple reasons: 1) P3 priority means it resolves before most defensive spells, 2) The immediate 1 damage brings the opponent to 3 HP while we have Break active, creating pressure, 3) It has advance effects which synergize with our active Break and maintains board presence, 4) Constellation is too risky as a conjury that could be cancelled, and Gleam's PA priority is too slow for the current tempo.
  Clash 3: YOU played Constellation
    Your strategy: Playing Constellation (P5 Conjury) is the optimal choice here. With Break and Starfall already active, I'm in a strong position for damage output. Constellation will add additional pressure and advance effects that synergize with my Aster strategy. While Gleam is tempting for its advance effects, playing a P5 spell before PA ensures I get value even if the opponent tries to disrupt my advance chain. The Conjury status makes it vulnerable to damage, but with the enemy at 3 HP and likely focused on survival, they may not have resources to cancel it. This maintains offensive momentum while setting up future clashes.
  Clash 4: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Playing Starfall is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) With Break and Constellation active, we can potentially set up powerful combinations for next round. 2) The P3 damage could reduce enemy to 2 HP, putting them in a more vulnerable position. 3) Most importantly, Starfall's advance effects will carry forward, giving us momentum into the next round. Even though the enemy has Renew active, maintaining offensive pressure is crucial.

  "analysis": "This was a strategically complex round with both players making strong positional plays. Let's analyze the key moments:

STRONG POINTS IN OUR PLAY:
1. Opening with Break (P1) was excellent, establishing Thunder synergy and providing strategic flexibility
2. The Starfall chains created consistent pressure while maintaining board presence
3. Using Constellation despite its Conjury risk was correct - the opponent was too pressured to spare resources to cancel it

OPPONENT'S STRONG MOVES:
1. Their Renew + Shrine combo shows excellent defensive positioning
2. Encumber was well-timed to slow our advance effects
3. They've maintained card advantage going into next round

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
Current state (3/5 HP vs 2/6 HP) slightly favors us, but it's more complex than it appears:
- We have stronger board presence with Break + Constellation
- Their Renew + Shrine healing engine is concerning
- The HP differential is meaningful but not decisive

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. The opponent's defensive layering with Ichor spells demonstrates strong fundamentals
2. Our Thunder + Aster combination proved effective at maintaining pressure through disruption
3. The tempo battle favored our aggressive stance, forcing them to play reactively

SURPRISING ELEMENTS:
The opponent's commitment to Ichor-based defense rather than trying to race us was strategically sound but ultimately couldn't fully neutralize our pressure. Their Shrine placement showed advanced understanding of defensive positioning.

The round ultimately favored us due to superior spell sequencing, but the opponent's defensive play kept them in a competitive position. Going into the next round, we'll need to respect their healing potential while maintaining our offensive momentum."

OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Critical strategic decision point. At 3/5 HP vs enemy's 2/6 HP, increasing my max health with Reinforce (Bolster 1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) P2 priority means it resolves before most responses, 2) Permanently increasing max health is more valuable than temporary healing from Defend when we're in a close endgame, 3) Keeping Besiege for later gives more flexibility with its advance effects, 4) If enemy tries to finish me this clash, having higher max health improves survival chances.
  Clash 2: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Daybreak's P1 speed. At 1 HP with enemy at 2 HP, I need the fastest possible response since enemy Quickshot could be lethal. Daybreak at P1 will resolve before any potential damage, and its effects could turn the tide. While Defend would heal, its P3 might be too slow, and Besiege at P4 is definitely too slow given the precarious health situation.
  Clash 3: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires immediate bolstering. At 1 HP, I need to increase my max health to survive. Reinforce (P2) will resolve before enemy's Quickshot (P3), giving me crucial survivability. While Defend could heal, it wouldn't increase my max health buffer. Besiege is too slow at P4 and doesn't help defensively.
  Clash 4: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: Critical defensive situation requires Defend. At 1 HP with enemy's Quickshot and Familiar both active, I need healing to survive. Defend at P3 will heal me before their P4 attacks hit. While Besiege could deal damage, survival takes priority when we're both close to trunk loss.

  "analysis": "This was an extremely close round that showcased high-level defensive play and resource management from both sides. Let's break it down:

Key Strategic Elements:

1. Health Management
- Starting at 3/5 HP, I executed a calculated defensive strategy using Reinforce to increase my buffer
- The opponent's aggressive Shadow-based pressure forced me into pure survival mode
- Ending at 1/7 HP is precarious but the increased max health from Reinforce proved crucial

2. Priority Control
- Excellent use of Daybreak's P1 priority to ensure defensive positioning
- Opponent's Shadow package (Sap, Familiar, Imitate) created strong pressure but couldn't quite secure lethal
- The priority layering between my P2 Reinforce and their attacks was critical

3. Resource Efficiency
- Opponent burned through their entire hand trying to secure lethal
- I maintained one card while establishing multiple active effects
- The Metal-based defensive package (Reinforce, Defend) proved its worth

Critical Decision Point:
The first clash Reinforce was the game-defining play. By choosing to bolster rather than heal, it set up a larger health pool that ultimately prevented trunk loss despite dropping to 1 HP.

Opponent's Strong Points:
- Excellent Shadow synergy package
- Smart pressure sequencing with Quickshot + Familiar
- Forced extremely defensive plays from my side

Areas for Opponent Improvement:
- Could have saved one card for next round
- Might have over-committed to the all-in strategy

This round demonstrated the razor's edge between aggression and defense in high-level play. While both players showed mastery, the early defensive positioning with Reinforce proved to be the deciding factor."

YOUR STATUS: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Quake
    Your strategy: In this critical situation with both players at low HP, Quake's P2 priority is crucial. At 1/7 HP, I need fast, reliable effects that can't be easily disrupted. While Aftershocks and Crepuscule are powerful, their P5 priority and Conjury status make them too risky - they could be cancelled before resolving. Crush's P3 weaken effect is good but slightly too slow. Quake at P2 will resolve before most responses and can potentially secure the win before the opponent's spell resolves.
  Clash 2: YOU played Crush
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires aggressive play. Crush at P3 is the optimal choice because: 1) It's faster than the other options (P3 vs P5), ensuring it resolves before potential lethal damage 2) The Weaken 1 effect can permanently reduce enemy's max HP, making them more vulnerable 3) Aftershocks and Crepuscule being Conjuries are too risky at 1 HP since they can be cancelled easily 4) With Quake already active, maintaining earth pressure is strategically sound

[SAVANT] API Response:

  "analysis": "Let's break down this critical round that led to victory through precise priority manipulation and risk assessment:

KEY WINNING DECISIONS:
1. Choosing Quake (P2) over higher damage but riskier Conjury spells was crucial. Against a wounded opponent, securing guaranteed damage through faster priority was more important than potentially higher but cancellable damage.

2. Following up with Crush (P3) demonstrated strong priority sequencing. The weaken effect created additional pressure while maintaining the earth element advantage.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Playing Grow (Wood) in this situation was suboptimal. While it provides healing, its slower priority meant it wouldn't save them from faster damage sources. A defensive P2 spell would have been better.

2. Agonize (Venom) shows they were trying to pressure our health, but without proper priority protection, they couldn't establish board control.

TECHNICAL EXECUTION:
The victory came through understanding priority windows. By playing P2 into P3, we created a sequence that:
- Resolved before opponent's slower spells
- Maintained element pressure
- Avoided vulnerability to cancellation
- Created compound pressure through damage + weaken

This demonstrates the core grandmaster principle: Victory often comes not from raw damage output, but from controlling the priority stack and forcing opponents to play reactively rather than proactively.

LEARNING POINT:
When at critical health thresholds, priority becomes more important than raw effect power. A guaranteed P2 damage spell is often better than a potentially stronger but slower or more vulnerable option."

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Aftershocks
    Your strategy: Aftershocks is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The opponent is at critical health (2/5 HP) and Aftershocks deals 2 damage, which would force a trunk loss. 2) While it's a Conjury that could be cancelled, its Priority 5 means most cancels would need to happen at P1-P4, requiring specific responses. 3) Even if cancelled, it forces the opponent to use resources defending rather than setting up their own win condition. 4) If it resolves, the advance effects provide ongoing value in future clashes. The alternative Crepuscule is also P5 but doesn't threaten lethal, while our P1/P2 options don't provide immediate pressure on their low health.
  Clash 2: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: This is a critical moment with several key factors: 1) The opponent is at 2/5 HP with Overexert active, making them vulnerable 2) I have Aftershocks active which can deal damage 3) Coalesce at P1 will resolve before most effects and can advance other spells. Coalesce's Priority 1 timing and advance effects synergize perfectly with Aftershocks, potentially setting up lethal damage. While Accelerator is also P1, being a Conjury makes it vulnerable to cancellation. Crepuscule is too slow at P5, and Clap at P2 doesn't provide the same strategic advantage as Coalesce's P1 timing.
  Clash 3: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: This is a critical clash where timing is everything. The enemy is at 1 HP and I already have Aftershocks and Coalesce active. Accelerator (P1) is the perfect choice here because:

1. As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything else, letting me manipulate the timing of my active spells
2. Being a Conjury doesn't matter much since the enemy is focused on survival at 1 HP
3. The advance effects will help set up future clashes if needed
4. Most importantly, it will accelerate my Aftershocks, which combined with Coalesce's boost should be enough to secure the kill before the enemy can respond

Clap would be too slow at P2, and Crepuscule at P5 would give the enemy too much time to respond. The P1 timing of Accelerator is crucial here.
