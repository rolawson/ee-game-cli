[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 4 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Opening with Reinforce (P2 Metal Remedy) is a strong proactive play for several reasons: 1) Early bolster effect permanently increases our max HP, giving long-term value 2) P2 priority means it resolves before most attacks/responses, ensuring the bolster takes effect 3) Metal element suggests opponent may have drafted aggressive cards - higher max HP helps defend against that 4) Keeps our Venom cards for when we can better leverage their advance effects in later clashes/rounds
  Clash 2: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: This is a critical defensive position that requires immediate healing. With only 3 HP and facing an opponent at 5 HP, I need to stabilize my health pool. Defend (P3) is the optimal choice because: 1) It heals for 1, bringing me to 4 HP which is safer against potential burst damage, 2) It has advance effects that can provide continued value, 3) It synergizes with my active Reinforce spell, showing good Metal element consistency. The enemy's Crepuscule is concerning, but building defensive momentum is key right now. The other options like Agonize or Enfeeble would push damage, but I'm not in a position to race - I need to shore up my defenses first.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Encumber (P2) is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At 3 HP, we need to be defensive and our active Reinforce/Defend combo will help sustain us. 2) Encumber's P2 priority lets us act before most attacks, potentially disrupting the opponent's strategy. 3) The advance effects will give us continued pressure next clash. 4) The other options (Agonize, Enfeeble, Besiege) are all attack spells which may be less effective against the opponent's Twilight setup and would resolve after their potential attacks due to lower priorities.
  Clash 4: YOU played Besiege
    Your strategy: I'll play Besiege here. While both options deal 1 damage, Besiege synergizes better with my active Metal spells (Reinforce and Defend). The enemy is at 5 HP with Twilight/Shadow spells active, suggesting they're running a control-oriented deck. My Metal package can help me weather their strategy while building board presence. Additionally, since this is the final clash of the round, Besiege's advance effects could provide value going into next round, helping me maintain pressure despite my lower HP.

  "analysis": "This opening round revealed interesting strategic dynamics from both sides. Let's analyze the key points:

STRONG ELEMENTS OF MY PLAY:
1. The Metal-heavy defensive package (Reinforce + Defend + Besiege) showed excellent synergy and established a solid defensive foundation
2. Sequencing was optimal - opening with P2 Reinforce before opponent could establish threats
3. Encumber provided disruption while maintaining defensive posture
4. Maintained card advantage by forcing opponent to react to our sustained pressure

OPPONENT'S STRONG MOVES:
1. Excellent Twilight/Shadow element synergy with Eventide/Familiar/Daybreak combination
2. Their card advantage (4 cards vs our 2) gives them strategic flexibility going into round 2
3. Clever use of Twilight's passive effects to maintain board presence

CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
- The health differential (5 vs 3) resulted from their effective pressure despite our defensive stance
- Their 4-card hand suggests they managed resources better than we did

STRATEGIC LESSONS:
1. While our Metal-based defense was solid, we may need to be more aggressive in finding damage windows
2. The opponent's Twilight/Shadow combination suggests they're running a control deck - we should prepare for a longer game
3. Card advantage will be crucial - need to maximize value from our remaining 2 cards

LOOKING AHEAD:
- Must leverage our active spells' advance effects efficiently
- Consider aggressive plays if opportunity arises, as purely defensive play may give opponent too much room to set up
- Watch for Twilight/Shadow interaction patterns to predict and counter their strategy

The opponent demonstrated strong fundamentals, but our defensive foundation gives us tools to fight back. Key to victory will be converting our defensive position into offensive pressure while maintaining resource parity."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: At 3/6 HP and significantly weakened max HP, I need to stabilize my position. Reinforce at P2 is an excellent choice here because:

1. It bolsters my max HP back up, which is critical given my weakened state
2. The P2 priority means it will resolve quickly, before most attacks
3. While Quickshot offers offensive pressure, I'm more concerned about survival right now
4. The Time boosts (Accelerator/Repeater) are powerful but risky as Conjuries when I'm at low health

This play sets me up to be more aggressive in future clashes while immediately improving my defensive position.
  Clash 2: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Selecting Accelerator (P1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 3 HP, I need to be proactive rather than reactive 2) Accelerator's P1 means it resolves before potential threats 3) Being a Time specialist, I can leverage advance effects to build momentum 4) While both Accelerator and Repeater are conjuries, Accelerator's P1 makes it harder to counter 5) The enemy's Coalesce suggests they're setting up for something - I need to disrupt their timing
  Clash 3: YOU played Repeater
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where Repeater offers the strongest strategic play. At 2 HP, I need to survive this clash and the next. The enemy has Crepuscule active which likely means more Twilight spells incoming. Repeater as a Time boost will work with my active Accelerator to potentially speed up future spells and create priority advantages. While Quickshot could deal 2 damage, it's more important to set up defenses and maintain board control. Additionally, as a Conjury, Repeater can absorb a hit if targeted, providing some protection.
  Clash 4: YOU played Quickshot
    Your strategy: Playing Quickshot (P3) is the optimal choice here. With only 2 HP remaining and the enemy at 5 HP, we need to apply pressure. While Quickshot is a Conjury and therefore vulnerable to cancellation, there are several factors that make this play strong:

1. We have Accelerator and Repeater active, which should enhance our Time magic
2. The enemy's active spells don't show any obvious cancel effects
3. Priority 3 means it will resolve before many defensive options
4. Even if countered, forcing the enemy to spend resources dealing with our threat is valuable

This play represents our best chance to deal meaningful damage before the round ends.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Reinforce (Metal)
  - YOUR Accelerator (Time)
  - YOUR Quickshot (Time)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Crepuscule (Twilight)
  - THEIR Imitate (Shadow)
  - THEIR Coalesce (Twilight)
  - THEIR Sap (Shadow)

{
  "analysis": "This round demonstrated high-level play from both sides, but ultimately my position deteriorated due to several key factors:

CRITICAL MISTAKES IN MY LINE OF PLAY:
1. The Accelerator + Repeater combo, while theoretically powerful, left me too vulnerable by committing to two Conjuries when already at low health. This allowed the opponent to maintain pressure.

2. Quickshot in clash 4 was overly aggressive - I should have prioritized survival over damage given my precarious 2 HP position.

OPPONENT'S STRONG PLAYS:
1. Excellent element synergy between Shadow and Twilight, using Crepuscule as setup for future plays
2. Smart use of Imitate to copy beneficial effects while maintaining card advantage
3. Sap was well-timed to capitalize on my weakened state

STRATEGIC LESSONS:
- When at low HP, prioritize guaranteed defensive options over risky Conjury setups
- The opponent's Shadow/Twilight combination proved more resilient than my Time-focused strategy
- Card efficiency was critical - opponent maintained hand advantage while I emptied my hand

INNOVATIVE PLAYS:
The opponent's use of Imitate showed deep understanding of copying mechanics and timing. Rather than using it reactively, they positioned it proactively to maximize value.

KEY LEARNING:
In competitive play, maintaining a healthy life total is more important than setting up elaborate combinations. My Time-based engine, while powerful, left me too exposed. Against Shadow/Twilight, I needed to play more conservatively and focus on stabilizing my position rather than trying to build momentum with vulnerable Conjuries."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: At 2 HP, I'm in a very dangerous position and need immediate healing. Defend (P3) provides crucial healing while also having advance effects for future clashes. While Break (P1) and Clap (P2) offer powerful advance effects, surviving this clash is the top priority. Stupefy could be risky without knowing the opponent's play. The Metal element of Defend may also provide favorable interactions against potential Thunder plays from the opponent.
  Clash 2: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 2 HP, we need defensive options and Break's high priority ensures it resolves before potential threats 2) Break has advance effects which provides continued value 3) Eventide is active on opponent's side, suggesting they may be setting up a big Twilight play - having Break's effects active could help counter that 4) While Clap and Stupefy are strong options, their P2 priority makes them riskier when we're at low health
  Clash 4: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Playing Stupefy here is our best option. Even though we're at low health (2/7), we have multiple protective spells active (Defend, Break, Clap) that can help us survive. The enemy has Familiar which could be dangerous, but our Thunder-based spells can help counter Shadow strategies. Most importantly, we need to maintain offensive pressure while protected to try to secure a trunk advantage.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Defend (Metal)
  - YOUR Break (Thunder)
  - YOUR Clap (Thunder)
  - YOUR Stupefy (Thunder)

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong defensive positioning and Thunder element synergy from our side, though we remain in a precarious position at 2 HP. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Defensive Layering: The sequence of Defend → Break → Clap → Stupefy created an excellent protective matrix while maintaining offensive pressure. The Metal + Thunder combination provides both immediate protection and ongoing threat.

2. Priority Management: Using Break's P1 priority was crucial, as it ensured our defensive boost would resolve before potential threats. This was especially important given our low HP situation.

OPPONENT'S PLAYS:
- Their Familiar + Repeater + Daybreak setup shows sophisticated planning, likely setting up for a major Twilight-based offensive.
- The Daybreak play suggests they may be holding Twilight spells for a finishing combination.

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
- At 2/7 HP vs their 4/5 HP, we're in danger but have strong active spells
- Our Thunder-heavy board state (Break, Clap, Stupefy) gives us excellent offensive positioning
- Their Shadow + Time + Twilight combination suggests they're planning a complex finishing sequence

KEY LEARNING:
The opponent's element diversity (Shadow/Time/Twilight) shows strong draft planning. While our Thunder-focus is powerful, we need to be wary of potential element-based counterplays in the next round.

NEXT ROUND CONSIDERATIONS:
- We must maintain defensive positioning while looking for opportunities to pressure their remaining trunks
- Their single card in hand could be a crucial Twilight spell - we need to play around potential finishing combinations
- Our active spells provide good protection, but we can't afford to be purely defensive at 2 HP"

OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires immediate action. At 2/7 HP, I'm extremely vulnerable. Overexert at P1 is the optimal play here because:
1. Fastest priority (P1) gives me initiative
2. Blood magic suggests opponent likely has limited defensive options
3. Can potentially close out a trunk before opponent can respond
4. Lower health pools in Round 4 make P1 damage extremely threatening
5. Holding Ritual and Encumber provides strong follow-up options depending on opponent's response

  "analysis": "This has been a fascinating endgame situation that demonstrates the importance of priority management and health thresholds. Let's break it down:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Health Management: We're at 6/6 HP with 2 trunks while opponent is at 4/5 HP with 3 trunks. This puts us in a precarious position where we can't afford mistakes.

2. Card Advantage: Our single card vs opponent's 3 cards puts us at a significant disadvantage. Each play must be extremely impactful.

3. Active Spells: Opponent's Crepuscule (Twilight) suggests they're setting up for a longer-term strategy, which is concerning given their card advantage.

Critical Decision Point - Overexert Play:
- The P1 Overexert play was technically sound given our desperate position
- However, opponent's maintained trunk advantage shows they've likely been more efficient with their resources

Opponent's Superior Position:
1. Card Advantage (3:1): Gives them significantly more options
2. Trunk Lead (3:2): More room for aggressive plays
3. Active Twilight: Provides ongoing value

Learning Points:
1. Earlier resource management was likely suboptimal on our part, leading to this card disadvantage
2. Opponent has shown excellent resource conservation while maintaining pressure
3. The Twilight setup shows forward-thinking strategy rather than just reactive plays

The opponent has demonstrated superior long-term planning and resource management. While our individual plays like Overexert were tactically sound, the strategic position suggests we need to improve our early-game resource management to avoid such disadvantageous late-game scenarios."

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/3 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Opening with Break (P1 Thunder boost) is strategically sound for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves first, potentially setting up advantageous interactions with future spells 2) Being a Thunder boost spell, it can enable powerful Thunder combinations in subsequent clashes 3) The advance effects can provide ongoing value throughout the round 4) Starting conservatively with a boost rather than committing to an attack pattern gives me more flexibility to react to the opponent's strategy
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Selecting Stupefy is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Break already active, we have Thunder synergy that could be valuable. 2) At Priority 2, it's fast enough to potentially disrupt enemy plays. 3) We want to save our Venom cards (Agonize, Encumber, Enfeeble) for a more coordinated poison strategy later. 4) The enemy has Accelerator active, suggesting they may be setting up for speed-based plays - Stupefy's response effects could help counter that. 5) Clap, while also P2, is better saved for when we need its advance effects specifically.
  Clash 3: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Playing Clap (Thunder) here is optimal for several reasons: 1) At P2, it's fast enough to combine with our active Break and Stupefy for maximum Thunder synergy this clash. 2) The enemy is already at 3 HP, making them vulnerable to our Thunder combo potential. 3) The boost/advance effects from Clap will continue providing value. 4) We want to avoid using our Venom cards suboptimally - they're more valuable when we can chain their effects together in a future clash.
  Clash 4: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: With the enemy at 1 HP and multiple active Thunder spells providing advantages, Enfeeble is the safer play here. While Encumber has a better priority (P2), the enemy is likely to lose their last trunk this clash regardless due to our established board presence. Enfeeble's P4 damage provides insurance if somehow our other effects don't connect, and its advance effects could be valuable going into the next round after the enemy loses a trunk and becomes invulnerable.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful execution of Thunder-based control that successfully pressured the opponent from 5 HP down to 1 HP while maintaining board presence and hand advantage. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Opening with Break (P1) established early Thunder synergy and created a foundation for the entire round
2. The Thunder spell sequence (Break → Stupefy → Clap) demonstrated excellent priority management and spell chaining
3. Maintained card advantage, ending with 2 cards while opponent is empty-handed
4. Successfully countered opponent's Time-based strategy (Accelerator/Repeater) with faster priority spells

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Over-committed to Time setup spells (Accelerator/Repeater) without sufficient protection
2. Playing Offering (Blood) showed desperation - trading cards for temporary HP when already under pressure
3. Failed to maintain sufficient defensive options against Thunder damage
4. Empty-handed going into next round severely limits their recovery options

INNOVATIVE ASPECTS:
The decision to hold Venom cards rather than mixing them suboptimally with Thunder shows high-level strategic planning. This preserves a potential Venom chain for future rounds while maximizing current Thunder synergy.

LEARNING OPPORTUNITY:
While successful, we could have potentially achieved the same pressure with more efficiency. Encumber in clash 4 was arguably unnecessary since the opponent was already at 1 HP - this card could have been saved for future rounds.

NEXT ROUND POSITIONING:
With 2 cards in hand and opponent at 1 HP with no cards, we're extremely well positioned. The opponent will likely need to play defensively to rebuild their hand, giving us initiative in the next round."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/3 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Selecting Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 1 HP, they are likely to play defensively with heals/remedies - Break's P1 will let me respond to their plays faster in future clashes 2) Thunder element provides strong follow-up options 3) The advance effects will provide ongoing value 4) Saving Agonize/Enfeeble combo for when I can maximize their synergy 5) P1 priority gives me the most flexibility to react to opponent's likely defensive plays
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy at P2 is the optimal play here. With enemy at 1 HP and Break active, we want fast priority to secure the trunk loss. Stupefy at P2 beats most defensive options and resolves before their P3+ spells. The P3/P4 Venom options are too slow - enemy could heal or protect at P2. Additionally, Break's boost effect makes our Thunder spells more impactful.
  Clash 3: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Choosing Agonize (P3) over Enfeeble (P4) for several critical reasons: 1) The higher priority is essential when the enemy is at 1 HP - we need to secure the trunk removal before they can potentially heal or protect themselves. 2) Both cards deal 1 damage, but Agonize's P3 means it will resolve before most defensive options. 3) With Break active, our Thunder spells deal +1 damage, but that's less relevant since either card would secure the trunk here. The advance effect on Agonize could be valuable next clash while the enemy is invulnerable.
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Enfeeble is the perfect play here. The opponent is at 1 HP, and Enfeeble deals 1 damage at P4. While they have Break active (which could theoretically protect against some damage), my own Break is also active, which should ensure the damage goes through. Additionally, Enfeeble advances, which gives value if they somehow survive. Given their HP situation and my guaranteed damage, this should secure the round.

  "analysis": "Let's analyze this round from a grandmaster perspective:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Opening with Break (P1) proved masterful - it set up Thunder synergies and provided priority control that became crucial throughout the round.
2. The opponent's Shadow-heavy strategy with Imitate/Sap/Familiar showed intent to build a defensive wall, but their timing was suboptimal.

Critical Decision Points:
- Clash 2's Stupefy at P2 was particularly well-executed. It demonstrated understanding of priority windows - P2 Thunder damage with Break active meant the opponent couldn't safely deploy defensive options.
- The Agonize into Enfeeble sequence (Clashes 3-4) showed expert spell sequencing. Using P3 before P4 maintained pressure while ensuring damage would connect.

Opponent's Key Mistakes:
1. Over-investment in Shadow elements without sufficient immediate defensive value
2. Allowing their HP to drop to 1 without maintaining P1-P2 defensive options
3. Suboptimal use of Break - they needed to leverage it for protection rather than offense when at low HP

Innovative Elements:
The Break + Stupefy Thunder synergy was particularly elegant - it created a priority-based damage window that's difficult to defend against without specific P1 counters.

Learning Opportunities:
- For the opponent: When at 1 HP, prioritize immediate defensive options over long-term spell chains
- The importance of element diversity - their heavy Shadow commitment left them vulnerable to faster Thunder-based pressure

This round demonstrated the core principle of high-level Elemental Elephants: priority control combined with element synergy creates windows where damage becomes nearly unavoidable."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/4 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: With the enemy at 1/5 HP, they are extremely vulnerable and likely to play defensively with healing or protection. Clap (P2) is the perfect choice here because:

1. Its Priority 2 means it will resolve before most defensive spells (P4-5)
2. The Thunder response effect could punish defensive plays
3. The advance effect gives ongoing value if they survive
4. The other options (Ichor Conjuries) are too slow at P5 and risk being cancelled

While the Conjury options are powerful, they would resolve too late to prevent the enemy from stabilizing. Clap gives us the best chance to close out the game before they can recover.
  Clash 2: YOU played Renew
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where maximizing survival is key. With the enemy at 1 HP but having active Eventide (which can enable powerful Twilight combinations), I need to shore up my defenses. Renew is perfect here because:

1. The Bolster effect permanently increases my max HP, which persists even if I lose a trunk
2. The immediate heal gets me to 3 HP, making me more resilient against potential burst damage
3. Being a Conjury makes it vulnerable, but it's worth the risk given the defensive benefits
4. Priority 5 means it resolves late, letting me see enemy aggression first

While Shrine and Dominion offer powerful effects, they're riskier plays when I need guaranteed value. The enemy's low HP means I don't need to force aggression - I can play defensively and wait for the right moment to strike.
  Clash 3: YOU played Dominion
    Your strategy: Choosing Dominion is the optimal play here. With the enemy at just 1 HP, we need reliable damage to secure a trunk break. While both options are P5 Conjuries, Dominion's attack potential is more valuable than Shrine's utility given the current game state. Even if the enemy manages to cancel Dominion, we still have Clap and Renew active which puts us in a strong position. The enemy's Daybreak active spell doesn't directly threaten our Conjury, making this a relatively safe play.

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated masterful strategic positioning and resource management. Let's break down the key elements:

STRONG PLAYS:
1. Opening with Clap (P2) was tactically brilliant:
- Perfect priority positioning to threaten their low HP
- Thunder response effect created a lose-lose situation for defensive plays
- Advance effect generates ongoing value
- Forces opponent to respect potential damage each clash

2. Defensive pivot with Renew was well-timed:
- Increased survivability through both heal and bolster
- Created buffer against potential counterplay
- Being a Conjury was an acceptable risk given board state

3. Dominion as closer showed patience and threat assessment:
- Maintained pressure while having Clap as backup
- Even if cancelled, forced opponent to spend resources

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
The opponent's position at 5/5 HP suggests they successfully stabilized despite our pressure. This indicates they:
- Had strong defensive options ready
- Managed resources well under pressure
- Possibly outmaneuvered our Clap timing

LEARNING POINTS:
1. Consider if we could have sequenced Clap differently to prevent their stabilization
2. Track what defensive tools they revealed for future rounds
3. Having only 1 card remaining vs their 2 suggests room for improved hand management

The round overall shows high-level play from both sides, with complex priority manipulation and resource trading. The opponent demonstrated resilience, but we maintained board presence with three active spells heading into the next round."

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 2 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (Thunder P1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it gives us initiative and will resolve before any enemy actions 2) Being a boost with advance effects lets us set up future clashes while maintaining pressure 3) At 3/4 HP we need to be proactive rather than reactive 4) The enemy having 2 trunks means they're vulnerable - maintaining offensive pressure is key 5) Our other options are either too slow (Shrine P5) or more situational (Encumber/Stupefy P2s)
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Stupefy. At 1 HP, I need immediate protection and Thunder synergy with active Break. Stupefy can potentially stun the opponent while dealing damage, and its P2 priority ensures it resolves before most threats. Shrine is too slow at P5, and Encumber, while useful, doesn't provide the immediate protection needed.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Encumber. At 1 HP, I must prevent lethal damage. Encumber (P2) resolves before Quickshot and can reduce its damage. Additionally, Encumber advances to next clash, providing continued protection if needed. While Shrine offers powerful effects, as a Conjury it's too vulnerable given my low HP. The combination of Break and Stupefy with Encumber creates a strong defensive wall while maintaining pressure.

1. Opening with Break (P1) was tactically sound, establishing Thunder synergy and initiative
2. The Break → Stupefy → Encumber sequence created a powerful defensive wall while maintaining offensive pressure
3. Careful priority management ensured my spells resolved at optimal timing

OPPONENT'S NOTABLE PLAYS:
- Their Twilight-heavy strategy (Crepuscule + Eventide) showed good element synergy
- Using Quickshot demonstrated understanding of priority-based pressure
- Overexert was a calculated risk that showed aggressive intent

KEY DECISION POINTS:
The critical moment came in Clash 2 where my Stupefy provided both defense and maintained Thunder synergy from Break. This proved more valuable than holding it for later, as it forced the opponent into a defensive posture.

ENDGAME ANALYSIS:
The current position (4/4 HP vs 2/5 HP) reflects successful execution of a control strategy. With both players at 2 trunks, but me having card advantage (1 vs 0), I've established a winning position through careful resource management.

LEARNING POINTS:
- The opponent could have better sequenced their Twilight spells to maximize damage output
- Their aggressive use of Overexert without backup protection left them vulnerable
- The timing of Quickshot, while threatening, could have been better coordinated with their other spells

This round showcases how proper priority management and spell sequencing can create both offensive pressure and defensive stability simultaneously."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/3 HP, 2 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 1 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Selecting Clap (Thunder P2) for several strategic reasons: 1) With opponent at 2 HP, they're likely to play defensively with heals/remedies - Clap's P2 will resolve before most defensive options. 2) The advance effects give future value if they survive. 3) We want to save our Conjury spells since they're vulnerable to cancellation, and opponent may have responses ready given their low HP. 4) Priority 2 gives us excellent positioning to threaten lethal while staying ahead of most counters.
  Clash 2: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Enfeeble at P4 is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy is at 2 HP and we need to maintain pressure - Enfeeble's guaranteed 1 damage will put them at critical 1 HP. 2) While we have Conjury options, they're all P5 and more risky since they can be cancelled. 3) Enfeeble has advance effects that can help us in future clashes. 4) With Clap active, we want to play into its synergies rather than risk having our Conjuries cancelled.

  "analysis": "This round showcased effective pressure and strategic spell sequencing from our side. Let's analyze the key elements:

STRATEGIC SUCCESSES:
1. Priority Management
- Opening with Clap (P2) was technically sound, staying ahead of potential defensive plays
- Following with Enfeeble (P4) maintained consistent pressure while leveraging Clap's advance effects

2. Resource Efficiency  
- Avoided playing vulnerable Conjuries when ahead, denying opponent comeback potential
- Built compound pressure through advance effects from both spells

3. Board Control
- Maintained initiative while forcing opponent into reactive positions
- Successfully reduced opponent to their final trunk through calculated pressure

OPPONENT ANALYSIS:
- Their position at 1 trunk shows they've been pushed into a defensive corner
- Higher HP (5/5) suggests successful healing/defensive play, but at cost of board control
- Limited to 3 cards indicates potential resource constraints

KEY LEARNING:
The round demonstrates the power of consistent pressure over high-risk plays. Rather than overcommitting with Conjuries, we used reliable damage sources that compound over time.

LOOKING AHEAD:
With opponent at 1 trunk but healthy HP, they'll likely play defensively. Our strategy should:
1. Continue pressure while watching for desperate counterplays
2. Consider how to break through potential defensive stalling
3. Maintain card advantage to outlast their remaining resources"

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/3 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 1 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Selecting Stupefy (Thunder P2) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With opponent at 5 HP and only 1 trunk, we want to maintain pressure - Stupefy's P2 gives us a fast attack that's hard to counter. 2) The P5 Conjury spells are too slow and risky in this position since they can be cancelled. 3) While Break (P1) is fast, we want to save it for potential combo plays or defensive needs. 4) Stupefy's response effects give us additional value if opponent tries certain counter-plays. 5) At 3/3 HP ourselves with 2 trunks, we're in a strong position to be aggressive rather than defensive.
  Clash 2: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Stupefy already active and Accelerator on the opponent's side, having a P1 spell gives us control over the priority sequence. 2) Break's advance effects will help set up future clashes while being fast enough to avoid disruption. 3) Most importantly, with the opponent at 1 trunk, we need to maintain pressure - the Ichor conjuries are too slow at P5 and vulnerable to being cancelled. Break provides the best tempo play while protecting our position.
  Clash 3: YOU played Shrine
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where Shrine's complex effects could be game-changing. With both players having Break active, the damage potential is high, but I'm at a health disadvantage (3 vs 5). Shrine is a strong P5 play that can help control the battlefield and potentially set up for lethal damage in the final clash. While it's vulnerable to being cancelled as a Conjury, forcing the opponent to deal with it diverts their resources. The enemy having Imitate active makes me cautious of playing Renew or Dominion, as they could be copied for greater effect by the opponent.
  Clash 4: YOU played Dominion
    Your strategy: Playing Dominion here is the optimal choice for several reasons: 1) The opponent is at 5 HP with their last trunk - we need to push for lethal damage. 2) While it's P5 and a Conjury, the opponent likely has limited options in the final clash. 3) With our Break active and their Breaks active, there's a complex Thunder interaction that could work in our favor. 4) Renew wouldn't provide enough value at this critical juncture, and Repeater being PA makes it too slow for this final clash. 5) Dominion's complex effects could provide the finishing blow we need.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Stupefy (Thunder)
  - YOUR Break (Thunder)
  - YOUR Shrine (Ichor)
  - YOUR Dominion (Ichor)

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of play from our side, demonstrating expert understanding of priority manipulation and Thunder synergies. Let's break down the key moments:

STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS:
1. Opening with Stupefy (P2) was crucial - it applied early pressure while staying ahead of their Accelerator. This forced them to respect our Thunder damage potential.

2. The double Break sequence in Clash 2 was particularly interesting. While they matched our Break play, we maintained priority advantage due to being Ringleader. This priority control proved decisive.

3. Shrine into Dominion in the final clashes was a sophisticated closing sequence. Even though they're both P5 Conjuries, the opponent was forced into defensive positions due to our established board presence.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Their Imitate (Shadow) didn't find enough value - they could have waited for a more impactful spell to copy.
2. Double Break play was questionable with only one trunk remaining - it left them vulnerable to our Thunder damage chain.
3. Impact in the final clash showed desperation - a faster priority spell might have disrupted our Dominion.

INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS:
The most impressive aspect was our Thunder priority chain. By sequencing Stupefy -> Break -> Shrine -> Dominion, we created a cascade of effects that was difficult to counter. The opponent's Life total at 5 with one trunk meant any miscalculation would be fatal.

LEARNING POINTS:
For the opponent, this game demonstrates the importance of trunk management. At one trunk, playing aggressive spells like Break becomes much riskier. They should have focused on stabilizing their position rather than matching our aggression.

Overall, this round showcased high-level elemental synergy and priority manipulation, core skills for mastering Elemental Elephants."

[SAVANT] Round 7 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 7 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 1 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Renew
    Your strategy: With 2/3 HP and a vulnerable position, Renew is the optimal defensive play. The Bolster+Heal combination will get me to 3/4 HP, providing crucial survivability. While it's a Conjury that can be cancelled, it's worth the risk since I need the health buffer. The enemy has 1 trunk left, so I want to be in a strong position to deliver the finishing blow in coming clashes. The other options are more aggressive but don't address my immediate vulnerability.
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy has Sap active, which makes this a perfect time to use Stupefy's response effect. 2) At P2, it will resolve before most slower spells, allowing us to potentially disrupt enemy plans. 3) With enemy at 1 trunk and 5 HP, we need to maintain offensive pressure - any damage we can deal brings us closer to victory. 4) The other options are less impactful - Encumber/Clap's advance effects are too slow when we need immediate impact, and Enfeeble's P4 makes it too slow for this critical moment.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At P2, it's fast enough to potentially disrupt enemy plays 2) With Renew and Stupefy already active, adding another advance effect creates powerful momentum 3) Enemy is down to their last trunk, so maintaining pressure through advance effects is crucial 4) Enemy's active Sap suggests they're playing defensively - Encumber helps maintain offensive tempo
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 3/5 HP and only 1 trunk remaining, dealing that final point of damage to force their last trunk loss is critical. While Clap has a better priority (P2 vs P4), the guaranteed 1 damage from Enfeeble is more valuable in this winning position. Additionally, Enfeeble's advance effects will carry forward, potentially setting up future advantages if the game continues.

{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and pressure that showcased high-level strategic play from both sides. Let's break it down:

  KEY STRENGTHS OF MY PLAY:
  1. The Renew opening was crucial - converting a vulnerable 2/3 HP position into a more stable 3/4 HP while increasing max health
  2. Excellent spell sequencing with Stupefy → Encumber → Enfeeble creating layered pressure
  3. Maintained constant offensive momentum while simultaneously shoring up defenses

  OPPONENT'S STRONG POINTS:
  - Skillful use of Coalesce and Daybreak shows understanding of defensive positioning
  - Their Twilight element choices suggest they're playing a control-oriented strategy
  - Managing to stay alive at 2/5 HP with just one trunk shows resilience

  CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
  1. When my Renew resolved without being cancelled - this was the foundation for everything else
  2. The Stupefy play punishing their Sap demonstrated strong tactical awareness
  3. The advance chain of Encumber/Enfeeble created sustained pressure

  AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (OPPONENT):
  - Could have been more aggressive in trying to cancel my Renew Conjury
  - Letting multiple advance effects stack against them limited their options
  - May need to transition from defensive to offensive posture given their trunk disadvantage

  STRATEGIC OUTLOOK:
  With me at 3/4 HP and 2 trunks vs their 2/5 HP and 1 trunk, I've established a commanding position. The active spells favor me as well, with both Encumber and Enfeeble advancing to create continued pressure.

  This round demonstrated the importance of balancing immediate tactical needs (healing/survival) with setting up longer-term strategic advantages (advance effects). A textbook example of converting a vulnerable position into a winning one through methodical, calculated play."

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Nightglow
    Your strategy: Opening with Nightglow (P2) is a strong strategic choice for several reasons: 1) Its high priority ensures it resolves early, 2) The bolster effect provides permanent max HP increase which is valuable early game, 3) Being a Moonshine card gives flexibility for future synergies, 4) It has advance effects which can provide ongoing value. The P2 priority also lets us see how opponent plays before committing to more aggressive options.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Selecting Agonize (P3 Venom attack) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 3/6 HP, I need to maintain offensive pressure while the enemy is at 5/5 HP. 2) The P3 priority is important to ensure damage lands before potential enemy remedies at P4-5. 3) Agonize has advance effects which will provide ongoing value. 4) With Nightglow active, I have some defensive coverage if needed. The enemy's Crepuscule indicates they're running Twilight, so I need to be aggressive before they can setup their powerful late-game combinations.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber (P2) is optimal here for several reasons:
1. At 3 HP, I need to play defensively while maximizing synergy with my active Venom spells (Agonize)
2. The P2 priority lets me act before most attacks, giving better protection
3. Encumber's advance effects will continue providing value into the next clash
4. With Nightglow and Agonize already active, I have good spell momentum - adding another advancing spell maintains pressure
5. The other options (Enfeeble, Slumber, Bedim) are all slower P4/P5 which could leave me vulnerable
6. Enemy has Twilight spells active which often deal damage - the faster priority helps counter that
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Agonize and Encumber already active, adding another Venom spell maximizes synergy. 2) At P4, it will resolve before enemy remedies at P5 that could heal. 3) The 1 damage could be crucial as the enemy is at 5 HP - pushing them closer to a trunk loss. 4) The advance effect gives value next clash if we survive. Most importantly, we're at critical 3 HP - we need to focus on ending this round quickly through damage rather than trying to heal with Slumber, which would be too slow at P5.

{
  "analysis": "Let's break down this fascinating round from a grandmaster perspective:

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
1. Opening Dynamics
- My Nightglow opener was solid but ultimately got outpaced by their Twilight engine
- Opponent skillfully built their Twilight package (Crepuscule → Eventide → Daybreak → Coalesce)
- They've achieved superior board position with 4 active Twilight spells vs my 3 Venom

CRITICAL TURNING POINTS:
1. Clash 2 was pivotal
- My Agonize play was aggressive but perhaps premature
- Should have anticipated their Twilight buildup and held more defensive options
- Lost significant health here which put us in a defensive posture

2. Resource Management
- Opponent maintained card advantage (3 cards vs our 2)
- They've established better HP position (4/5 vs our 3/6)
- Their Twilight engine is fully operational while our Venom synergy is just starting

OPPONENT'S STRENGTHS:
- Excellent element consistency (pure Twilight build)
- Patient buildup of synergistic effects
- Maintained card advantage throughout
- Successfully pressured our health while building their engine

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT (Self):
1. Element Focus
- Mixed Moonshine (Nightglow) with Venom package reduced synergy
- Should have committed fully to one element strategy

2. Defensive Timing
- Could have sequenced defensive plays better to preserve health
- Got too aggressive with Agonize when opponent was clearly setting up

Looking ahead, we're in a challenging position. Their Twilight engine is fully operational while we're at critical health. Next round will require precise play and possibly some high-risk strategies to overcome their advantage.

This was a masterclass in Twilight engine building by our opponent - they deserve credit for their disciplined, systematic approach to establishing board control."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber with P2 priority for several strategic reasons: 1) At 3/6 HP, I need to be defensive while setting up future plays. Encumber's high priority gives me control over the clash. 2) Being a boost with advance effects, it can provide value over multiple clashes. 3) The opponent at 4/5 HP isn't in immediate danger, so rushing damage isn't crucial. 4) Having multiple Venom cards (Agonize, Enfeeble) suggests potential synergies I can set up with Encumber's effects for later clashes.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Selecting Agonize (P3) for several strategic reasons: 1) With Break active, the opponent likely wants to advance aggressive spells - Agonize's P3 lets me potentially disrupt before their main damage comes in. 2) At 3 HP, healing for 1 with Slumber isn't as valuable as maintaining offensive pressure. 3) With Encumber already active and another Venom spell, we can start building powerful venom synergies. 4) Agonize's advance effects give future value while keeping pressure. 5) Enfeeble at P4 would be too slow given the likely incoming aggression.
  Clash 3: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P4, it will resolve before their active Break and Clap effects, 2) The 1 damage could be crucial with enemy at 4 HP, 3) It synergizes with our active Venom spells Encumber and Agonize, strengthening our Venom-based strategy, 4) The advance effects will help maintain pressure into the final clash, and 5) While Slumber's healing is tempting at 3 HP, playing defensively now would waste our established offensive momentum with Venom effects.
  Clash 4: YOU played Slumber
    Your strategy: Playing Slumber here is critical for survival. At 1 HP, I absolutely need the heal to avoid losing a trunk. While Slumber is slow at P5, the enemy's active spells don't seem to include direct damage that would threaten me before it resolves. Additionally, Slumber's advance effect could provide value in future clashes of the next round.

  "analysis": "This was a fascinating round that demonstrated both strong strategic play and some key areas for improvement from both sides.

OPPONENT'S STRONG PLAYS:
- Excellent Thunder chain with Break → Clap → Stupefy showing forward planning
- Break in Clash 1 was well-timed to enable their subsequent Thunder combo
- Using Nightglow in final clash was smart to maintain pressure while advancing effects

MY EXECUTION:
- Successfully established a powerful triple-Venom engine (Encumber, Agonize, Enfeeble)
- Used priority effectively, especially P2 Encumber to get ahead of opponent's setup
- However, I made a critical error in Clash 3 that nearly cost me:
  * Playing Enfeeble at P4 was too greedy
  * Should have played Slumber then to stabilize HP earlier
  * This forced a desperate Slumber in Clash 4 at low HP

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. While my Venom strategy was strong, I prioritized offense over survival
2. The opponent's Thunder chain showed excellent spell sequencing
3. HP management is crucial - dropping to 2 HP was dangerous and preventable

The most interesting aspect was the clash of strategies:
- My Venom-based control approach vs their Thunder burst damage
- Both strategies were valid, but execution timing was key
- The round ended with both of us at relatively low HP, showing the effectiveness of both approaches

For improvement:
- I need to better balance aggression with survival
- Opponent could have potentially saved one Thunder spell for next round's setup
- Both of us ended with empty hands, suggesting room for better resource management

A technically complex round that showcased high-level strategy while highlighting the importance of timing and HP management."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Cleanse
    Your strategy: Choosing Cleanse is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 2/6 HP I need healing, but also need to apply pressure. Cleanse offers both healing and potential damage. 2) Priority 3 gives me good timing to both heal and potentially deal damage before slower spells. 3) Keeping Flow and Nourish gives me strong healing options for later clashes when needed. 4) With opponent at 4/6 HP, maintaining offensive pressure while stabilizing my health is key to turning this round around.
  Clash 2: YOU played Nourish
    Your strategy: In this critical position at 3/6 HP, Nourish is the optimal play for several reasons: 1) We need immediate healing to avoid trunk loss, and Nourish provides the most efficient healing (2 HP) 2) While Flow also heals, its advance effects are less valuable when we're in survival mode 3) Bedim's damage is too slow at P4 and doesn't help our defensive needs 4) We already have Cleanse active which could provide additional healing, so stacking healing effects maximizes our chance of stabilizing
  Clash 3: YOU played Flow
    Your strategy: Flow is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority will resolve before the enemy's Absorb, ensuring I get value from the heal 2) It synergizes with my active Water spells (Cleanse and Nourish), potentially setting up powerful combinations 3) The advance effect provides ongoing value 4) With both players at relatively high health, focusing on board control and spell synergy is more important than the minor damage from Bedim
  Clash 4: YOU played Bedim
    Your strategy: Playing Bedim (P4) is the optimal choice here. With both players at low health, damage potential is crucial. While Bedim only deals 1 damage, it can advance to keep pressure next round. More importantly, my active Flow spell suggests I'm running a Water-focused strategy, and maintaining board presence helps enable future Water synergies. The enemy's Crepuscule and Absorb show they're trying to stabilize through healing, so maintaining offensive pressure is key. Even if they heal, carrying Bedim forward creates future opportunities.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Cleanse (Water)
  - YOUR Nourish (Water)
  - YOUR Flow (Water)
  - YOUR Bedim (Moonshine)

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong technical play from both sides, but revealed some key strategic insights:

OPPONENT'S STRONG POINTS:
- Excellent defensive timing with Absorb and Crepuscule to stabilize their position
- Smart resource management keeping their health above critical thresholds
- Good element synergy between Nectar and Twilight effects

MY ADVANTAGES:
- Superior water synergy package with Cleanse/Nourish/Flow creating a powerful engine
- Better priority control through P3 spells allowing me to resolve key effects first
- More forward-looking strategy with advancing effects from Flow and Bedim

CRITICAL MOMENTS:
1. My early Cleanse play was crucial - it provided both healing and potential damage while enabling water synergies
2. The opponent's Absorb timing was slightly suboptimal - playing it after my P3 Flow meant they got less value
3. My triple Water spell sequence created strong board presence while maintaining health

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Water-heavy strategies excel at sustained pressure while maintaining health
- Priority manipulation is crucial - winning P3 vs P4 battles consistently generates advantage
- Advance effects become more valuable in drawn-out rounds

The round ended fairly evenly with both players at moderate health, but I believe I have a slight strategic advantage going into next round due to:
1. More active spells (4 vs 2)
2. Better element synergy
3. More advance potential

A masterclass in resource management and spell timing from both sides, though the opponent could improve their priority sequencing to better counter Water strategies."

[SAVANT] Round 4 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 4 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber is optimal here for several reasons: 1) It has the highest priority (P2) among our options, giving us initiative 2) As a response/boost with advance effects, it can provide defensive utility while setting up future clashes 3) At 3 HP, we need to play defensively while looking for opportunities to turn the game 4) Having Starfall in reserve gives us offensive options if an opening presents itself
  Clash 2: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Selecting Starfall is optimal here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority ensures it resolves before most defensive options 2) The 1 damage helps pressure their remaining HP 3) Being an Aster spell with advance effects positions us well for future clashes 4) With Encumber active, we want to maintain offensive pressure while they potentially have reduced options. Constellation is too risky as a Conjury that could be cancelled, while Gleam's PA priority makes it too slow for our current needs.
  Clash 3: YOU played Constellation
    Your strategy: Playing Constellation (P5) is the optimal choice here. With both players at low health and my Starfall already active, I need to maximize defensive positioning. While Gleam could advance, Constellation as a Conjury provides better strategic value. Even if it gets cancelled, it forces the opponent to commit resources to deal with it. If it survives, its advance effects will help control the final clash positioning. The enemy's Turbulence and Eventide suggest they're setting up for a final clash push, so establishing a strong defensive presence now is crucial.
  Clash 4: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Playing Starfall is the optimal choice in this critical endgame scenario. With both players at 2 HP and 3 trunks, this clash could decide the game. Starfall's P3 attack will resolve before the enemy's Turbulence (Wind response) and Blow (Wind basic). The 1 damage from Starfall is enough to reduce the opponent to 1 HP, and if they don't have healing, they'll be extremely vulnerable next round. Additionally, Starfall synergizes with our active Constellation boost, potentially setting up powerful advance effects for future plays.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and priority manipulation. Let's break down the key moments:

  STRONG PLAYS:
  1. Opening with Encumber (P2) was tactically sound, forcing opponent response and setting tempo
  2. Following up with Starfall demonstrated excellent priority management - P3 attack that advanced perfectly
  3. Using Constellation despite its vulnerability showed advanced risk assessment - opponent had to choose between cancelling it or dealing with Starfall

  OPPONENT'S DECISIONS:
  - Their Wind/Twilight combination (Turbulence + Eventide) suggests they're setting up for a powerful Round 5
  - However, they may have committed too heavily to future positioning while neglecting immediate threats
  - Letting Constellation resolve without cancellation was questionable - this could prove costly

  We've achieved a strong board state:
  - Both players at 2 HP, but we have active Constellation + Starfall
  - Their Wind spells are typically reactive, giving us initiative
  - Eventide suggests they lack immediate damage options

  KEY LEARNING:
  The opponent's focus on Wind/Twilight synergy is strategically sound, but their timing left them vulnerable. In Elemental Elephants, sometimes you must sacrifice perfect spell combinations to address immediate threats.

  Looking ahead to Round 5, we have established priority advantage and multiple active effects. The opponent will need exceptional card quality to overcome this position."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/6 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Scorch
    Your strategy: With both players at 2 HP and 3 trunks, this is an extremely critical clash. Scorch is the optimal play here because it offers the most versatile damage output while having potential advance effects. While Agonize has better priority (P3), dealing 1 damage isn't enough to secure the trunk. Fireball is too straightforward, and Ignite's 1 damage is insufficient. Scorch gives us the best chance of securing lethal damage while potentially setting up future clashes if the opponent survives.

OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Reflect (Sunbeam)

  "analysis": "This was a masterful endgame sequence that demonstrated strong fundamentals. Let's analyze the key aspects:

STRATEGIC ELEMENTS:
1. Our Scorch play was optimal given the situation:
   - At 2 HP vs 2 HP, every point of damage was critical
   - P3 priority meant it would resolve before most defensive options
   - The 2 damage output was exactly what we needed
   - Advance potential provided insurance if it didn't end the game

2. Opponent's Reflect was a solid defensive read:
   - They correctly anticipated a damage spell
   - P2 priority would protect against most attacks
   - However, they made a critical error choosing Reflect over other defensive options

KEY MISTAKE BY OPPONENT:
The opponent's choice of Reflect reveals inexperience with priority interactions. While Reflect is P2, it only works against P3 or slower spells. Against equal or faster priority spells, it fails to protect. A more experienced player might have:
- Used a P1 defensive spell if available
- Held multiple defensive options
- Positioned differently to avoid lethal damage

LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Priority mastery is essential in high-stakes situations
2. Understanding exact spell interactions can decide games
3. Having backup plans is crucial when defending lethal

The game state (6/6 HP vs 1/6 HP with trunk differential) shows we've established clear dominance through superior resource management and priority control. Our opponent needs to improve their understanding of defensive timing windows to compete at this level."

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 2/3 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Opening with Overexert (P1) is a powerful play for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent can play, guaranteeing its effect 2) It can set up strong follow-up plays with my Blood and Venom cards 3) The opponent likely won't expect such an aggressive opening, potentially disrupting their planned sequence 4) Having multiple Venom advance effects in hand (Agonize, Encumber, Enfeeble) means I can build pressure over subsequent clashes even if I take some early damage
  Clash 2: YOU played Ritual
    Your strategy: Playing Ritual (P3) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) Its P3 priority lets it resolve before the enemy's likely P4-P5 plays, synergizing with our active Agonize and Encumber. 2) The advance effects will help maintain pressure in future clashes. 3) With Blood element synergy from active Overexert, this creates a powerful offensive sequence. 4) Enfeeble would be slower at P4, and Offering's self-damage is risky when we're already at 4/5 HP.
  Clash 3: YOU played Offering
    Your strategy: Critical situation at 1 HP requires maximizing survival and damage potential. Offering is the superior choice here because:
1. With Ritual active, Offering will deal significant damage and potentially secure a trunk break
2. Enfeeble, while good, would be less impactful given our existing Venom stack
3. The enemy's Quickshot is concerning but we need to press our advantage while we have the Blood synergy active

  "analysis": "This was an excellent opening round that demonstrated high-level strategic play from both sides, though our aggressive sequence proved superior. Let's break it down:

KEY ADVANTAGES SECURED:
1. Trunk advantage gained (opponent down to 2/3 HP)
2. Card advantage (opponent forced to use more resources)
3. Successfully executed a 3-clash Blood/Venom combo sequence

CRITICAL DECISION POINTS:

Our Opening (Overexert):
- The P1 priority opening was crucial, establishing Blood synergy
- Taking calculated early damage (5→4 HP) enabled powerful follow-ups
- Opponent likely expected a more conservative opener, giving us initiative

Mid-Round Pivot (Ritual):
- Perfect timing at P3, threading between typical defensive responses
- Blood synergy amplified damage potential
- Advance effects maintained pressure through later clashes

OPPONENT'S KEY MISTAKES:
1. Quickshot timing was suboptimal - should have played it earlier to contest our Ritual
2. Familiar provided insufficient defensive coverage against our multi-element assault
3. Card sequencing revealed their hand too early, allowing us to play around their options

LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES:
- Opponent should consider holding Time spells for counter-timing
- Shadow defensive plays need better synchronization with offensive sequences
- Early trunk preservation sometimes matters more than card advantage

The most impressive aspect was our ability to convert a 1-card hand into a trunk advantage through precise priority sequencing. Moving forward, we should watch for Time-based counterplay as the opponent likely has answers to this strategy in their deck."

YOUR STATUS: 4/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Selecting Overexert (Blood, P1) is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 2/3 HP and me having priority advantage, a P1 spell gives the best chance to secure a trunk break before they can respond. Blood spells tend to have powerful immediate effects, and Overexert's P1 timing ensures it resolves first. The enemy's low health makes them vulnerable, and acting before they can heal or defend is crucial. While the Venom options offer interesting advance effects, the immediate pressure from a P1 Blood spell is more valuable in this position.
  Clash 2: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Playing Encumber (P2) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 1 HP and multiple Venom responses active (Enfeeble, Agonize), adding another Venom response maximizes damage potential if they play certain spell types. 2) The P2 priority ensures it resolves before most other spells, potentially affecting enemy plays. 3) The advance effect provides continued value in future clashes. 4) Most importantly, we want to maintain pressure while they're at critical HP - Ritual would be too slow at P3 and might give them room to recover.

  "analysis": "Let's break down Round 2's strategic dynamics:

  STRONG POINTS:
  - The P1 Overexert play was perfectly timed, applying critical pressure when opponent was vulnerable
  - Building a triple Venom response suite (Enfeeble, Agonize, Encumber) created a powerful defensive wall
  - Priority sequencing was optimal, using P1/P2 spells to maintain tempo
  
  OPPONENT MISTAKES:
  1. Failed to adequately protect against Blood damage, leaving themselves exposed to Overexert
  2. Allowed multiple Venom responses to stack, creating a dangerous response matrix
  3. Card efficiency issues - ending with 2 cards while we have active spells suggests suboptimal plays

  KEY LEARNING:
  The round showcases the power of priority control and element stacking. By building multiple Venom responses while maintaining Blood pressure, we created a 'lose-lose' situation for the opponent. If they play aggressively, Venom responses punish them. If they play defensively, they risk getting overwhelmed by direct damage.

  STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHT:
  The Encumber play in Clash 2 was particularly strong - not only did it add to our Venom response suite, but its P2 priority meant it could interact with enemy plays before they resolved. This type of priority-based control is a hallmark of high-level play.

  The opponent needs to improve their defensive timing and element diversity to counter such strategies in future rounds."

  "analysis": "This has become a critical position that demonstrates the importance of trunk management and health thresholds. Let's analyze the key aspects:

  POSITION ASSESSMENT:
  - We're at 1 trunk vs opponent's 2 trunks, putting us at a disadvantage
  - However, our 5/5 HP vs their 2/2 HP gives us a significant health advantage
  - Their active Quickshot indicates they're likely running a Time-based strategy
  
  KEY DECISION POINTS FROM ROUND 3:
  1. Our Overexert play was technically sound but perhaps too conservative given the trunk differential. We could have pursued a more aggressive line to pressure their remaining 2/2 HP.
  
  2. The opponent maintaining 4 cards while we're down to 2 suggests they've managed their resources better. This card advantage could become crucial in the final round.

  STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
  - The opponent's 2/2 HP means they're vulnerable to any 2+ damage play
  - However, their 4-card hand suggests they likely have defensive options
  - Our limited 2-card hand means we need to maximize value from each play

  LEARNING POINTS:
  1. The opponent has demonstrated good resource management by maintaining a larger hand
  2. They've effectively used their Time element to maintain board presence with Quickshot
  3. We could have been more aggressive earlier to capitalize on our health advantage

  This is a textbook example of how trunk advantage can offset a health disadvantage, forcing the player with more HP but fewer trunks to find lethal before running out of resources."

YOUR STATUS: 4/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (Thunder P1) is optimal for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent can play, giving us initiative 2) Thunder spells tend to be aggressive, and establishing early pressure is key 3) Having advance effects means it can continue providing value beyond this clash 4) It protects our P1 slot while keeping Clap and Stupefy as strong P2 responses for later clashes 5) We avoid playing our Conjury (Crepuscule) early when it's most vulnerable to cancellation
  Clash 2: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Daybreak is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) It's Priority 1, which means it will resolve before the enemy's spell and my active Break spell, 2) Having Break active makes Daybreak particularly potent as they can combo together, 3) The early clash positioning allows me to potentially set up future Twilight synergies, and 4) I want to maintain pressure while I have board advantage with Break active. Daybreak's fast Priority 1 timing ensures I can execute my strategy before the opponent can respond.
  Clash 4: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Coalesce is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P1, it resolves before enemy Quickshot, allowing me to potentially protect myself 2) With Break and Daybreak already active, Coalesce's synergy with other Twilight spells could provide significant value 3) With advance effects, it can carry forward momentum into next round 4) Being at 4/5 HP means I need to prioritize protection against the incoming Quickshot damage

  "analysis": "Let's break down this fascinating round from a grandmaster perspective:

STRONG POINTS IN OUR PLAY:
1. Excellent Priority Control: Our sequence of P1 spells (Break → Daybreak → Coalesce) demonstrated masterful priority manipulation, consistently acting before opponent
2. Element Synergy: Building a strong Twilight package while using Thunder for early pressure
3. Forward Momentum: Multiple advance effects position us well for next round

OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
1. Time Element Timing: Their Repeater/Quickshot combination came too late to prevent our setup
2. Resource Management: Ending with only 2 cards while we have 3 suggests suboptimal hand efficiency
3. Defensive Gaps: Failed to prevent our P1 spell chain, allowing us to establish board control

KEY TURNING POINTS:
- Break into Daybreak sequence was particularly strong, as it established both pressure and board presence
- Opponent's Encumber (Venom) shows they recognized the threat but couldn't effectively counter our priority advantage
- Our Coalesce play skillfully protected against their Quickshot while maintaining our strategy

STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS:
- We've established a strong Twilight presence which threatens powerful combinations next round
- Opponent's Time element suggests they'll try to regain tempo - we should prepare for acceleration effects
- Our 4/5 HP is acceptable given our board position and card advantage

AREAS TO WATCH:
1. Opponent still has 5/5 HP - we need to convert our board advantage into damage
2. Their remaining 2 cards could be powerful responses - maintain flexibility
3. Time/Venom combination suggests they might pivot to a control strategy

Overall, we've executed a superior opening strategy, but must remain vigilant as Time/Venom combinations can enable powerful comebacks if we get overconfident."

YOUR STATUS: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Playing Accelerator (Time P1 Conjury) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves first which is crucial for setting up tempo advantage 2) While it's vulnerable as a Conjury, the potential payoff of its advance effects is worth the risk 3) With both players at relatively high health, this is a good time to establish board presence rather than going for direct damage 4) Holding Stupefy and Clap gives us strong response options for later clashes, especially if the opponent tries to punish our Conjury setup
  Clash 2: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Selecting Clap here is optimal for several reasons: 1) With Accelerator active, I'm in a strong position to leverage advance effects. 2) The P2 priority matches Quickshot, and as Ringleader I'll resolve first, potentially disrupting their strategy. 3) Stupefy and Eventide, while powerful, don't synergize as well with my current board state and the advance potential Clap provides. 4) At 3/5 HP, I need to be proactive rather than reactive, and Clap's advance effects can help me maintain pressure.
  Clash 3: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Stupefy is the optimal play here for several key reasons: 1) With the same P2 priority as enemy's active Quickshot, I'll get to act first due to turn order advantage. 2) Stupefy's response effect can capitalize on the enemy's active spells. 3) The Thunder synergy with my active Clap spell could create a powerful combination. 4) At 3 HP, I need to maintain pressure rather than setting up with Eventide's boost effects.
  Clash 4: YOU played Eventide
    Your strategy: Playing Eventide here is the optimal choice for several reasons: 1) With both players at 3 HP and 3 trunks, we're in a critical position where trunk loss is imminent. 2) We already have Accelerator and Clap as active boosts, and Eventide's complex effects can potentially stack with these for maximum impact. 3) The P2 priority means it will resolve before most attacks, giving us tactical advantage. 4) The enemy's Quickshot is concerning, but our combination of active spells plus Eventide gives us the best chance to survive and potentially turn the situation in our favor.

  "analysis": "This was a masterfully played round that showcased high-level strategic positioning and spell sequencing. Let's break down the key elements:

  STRENGTHS OF OUR PLAY:
  1. Opening with Accelerator (P1) was crucial - it established board presence and created advance opportunities that would pay dividends throughout the round
  2. The Clap + Stupefy thunder synergy was well-timed and demonstrated excellent elemental awareness
  3. Our priority sequencing was impeccable - consistently leveraging Ringleader advantage to resolve before opponent's same-priority spells

  OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
  1. Their lone Quickshot, while a strong spell, left them vulnerable without supporting pieces
  2. They failed to protect against or punish our Conjury setup, missing a key opportunity to disrupt our strategy
  3. The lack of active spells suggests they may have over-committed to immediate effects rather than building board presence

  CRITICAL DECISION POINT:
  The final clash Eventide play was particularly sophisticated - it layered another complex effect onto our already strong board state while maintaining P2 priority. This demonstrates mastery of the 'stack and leverage' strategy that defines high-level play.

  LOOKING AHEAD:
  With both players at 3 HP, the next round will likely be decisive. Our superior board presence (4 active spells vs 1) gives us a significant advantage, but trunk loss mechanics mean we can't become overconfident.

  KEY LEARNING:
  This round perfectly illustrates why board development and spell synergy often trump pure damage racing in high-level play. The opponent's more direct approach left them without the tools to counter our sophisticated spell matrix."

YOUR STATUS: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At P1, it resolves before most spells, letting me see the opponent's play before committing to my advance effects 2) Both players are at 3/5 HP - a critical threshold where advance effects could be lethal 3) Having Gleam and Starfall as follow-up options gives me strong advance chains for the next clashes 4) Break's Thunder boost effects could help protect against common Round 3 burst damage patterns
  Clash 2: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Starfall is the optimal play here for multiple reasons: 1) P3 priority means it resolves before most defensive spells, 2) The immediate 1 damage brings the opponent to 3 HP while we have Break active, creating pressure, 3) It has advance effects which synergize with our active Break and maintains board presence, 4) Constellation is too risky as a conjury that could be cancelled, and Gleam's PA priority is too slow for the current tempo.
  Clash 3: YOU played Constellation
    Your strategy: Playing Constellation (P5 Conjury) is the optimal choice here. With Break and Starfall already active, I'm in a strong position for damage output. Constellation will add additional pressure and advance effects that synergize with my Aster strategy. While Gleam is tempting for its advance effects, playing a P5 spell before PA ensures I get value even if the opponent tries to disrupt my advance chain. The Conjury status makes it vulnerable to damage, but with the enemy at 3 HP and likely focused on survival, they may not have resources to cancel it. This maintains offensive momentum while setting up future clashes.
  Clash 4: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Playing Starfall is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) With Break and Constellation active, we can potentially set up powerful combinations for next round. 2) The P3 damage could reduce enemy to 2 HP, putting them in a more vulnerable position. 3) Most importantly, Starfall's advance effects will carry forward, giving us momentum into the next round. Even though the enemy has Renew active, maintaining offensive pressure is crucial.

  "analysis": "This was a strategically complex round with both players making strong positional plays. Let's analyze the key moments:

STRONG POINTS IN OUR PLAY:
1. Opening with Break (P1) was excellent, establishing Thunder synergy and providing strategic flexibility
2. The Starfall chains created consistent pressure while maintaining board presence
3. Using Constellation despite its Conjury risk was correct - the opponent was too pressured to spare resources to cancel it

OPPONENT'S STRONG MOVES:
1. Their Renew + Shrine combo shows excellent defensive positioning
2. Encumber was well-timed to slow our advance effects
3. They've maintained card advantage going into next round

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
Current state (3/5 HP vs 2/6 HP) slightly favors us, but it's more complex than it appears:
- We have stronger board presence with Break + Constellation
- Their Renew + Shrine healing engine is concerning
- The HP differential is meaningful but not decisive

KEY LEARNINGS:
1. The opponent's defensive layering with Ichor spells demonstrates strong fundamentals
2. Our Thunder + Aster combination proved effective at maintaining pressure through disruption
3. The tempo battle favored our aggressive stance, forcing them to play reactively

SURPRISING ELEMENTS:
The opponent's commitment to Ichor-based defense rather than trying to race us was strategically sound but ultimately couldn't fully neutralize our pressure. Their Shrine placement showed advanced understanding of defensive positioning.

The round ultimately favored us due to superior spell sequencing, but the opponent's defensive play kept them in a competitive position. Going into the next round, we'll need to respect their healing potential while maintaining our offensive momentum."

OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Critical strategic decision point. At 3/5 HP vs enemy's 2/6 HP, increasing my max health with Reinforce (Bolster 1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) P2 priority means it resolves before most responses, 2) Permanently increasing max health is more valuable than temporary healing from Defend when we're in a close endgame, 3) Keeping Besiege for later gives more flexibility with its advance effects, 4) If enemy tries to finish me this clash, having higher max health improves survival chances.
  Clash 2: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires Daybreak's P1 speed. At 1 HP with enemy at 2 HP, I need the fastest possible response since enemy Quickshot could be lethal. Daybreak at P1 will resolve before any potential damage, and its effects could turn the tide. While Defend would heal, its P3 might be too slow, and Besiege at P4 is definitely too slow given the precarious health situation.
  Clash 3: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires immediate bolstering. At 1 HP, I need to increase my max health to survive. Reinforce (P2) will resolve before enemy's Quickshot (P3), giving me crucial survivability. While Defend could heal, it wouldn't increase my max health buffer. Besiege is too slow at P4 and doesn't help defensively.
  Clash 4: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: Critical defensive situation requires Defend. At 1 HP with enemy's Quickshot and Familiar both active, I need healing to survive. Defend at P3 will heal me before their P4 attacks hit. While Besiege could deal damage, survival takes priority when we're both close to trunk loss.

  "analysis": "This was an extremely close round that showcased high-level defensive play and resource management from both sides. Let's break it down:

Key Strategic Elements:

1. Health Management
- Starting at 3/5 HP, I executed a calculated defensive strategy using Reinforce to increase my buffer
- The opponent's aggressive Shadow-based pressure forced me into pure survival mode
- Ending at 1/7 HP is precarious but the increased max health from Reinforce proved crucial

2. Priority Control
- Excellent use of Daybreak's P1 priority to ensure defensive positioning
- Opponent's Shadow package (Sap, Familiar, Imitate) created strong pressure but couldn't quite secure lethal
- The priority layering between my P2 Reinforce and their attacks was critical

3. Resource Efficiency
- Opponent burned through their entire hand trying to secure lethal
- I maintained one card while establishing multiple active effects
- The Metal-based defensive package (Reinforce, Defend) proved its worth

Critical Decision Point:
The first clash Reinforce was the game-defining play. By choosing to bolster rather than heal, it set up a larger health pool that ultimately prevented trunk loss despite dropping to 1 HP.

Opponent's Strong Points:
- Excellent Shadow synergy package
- Smart pressure sequencing with Quickshot + Familiar
- Forced extremely defensive plays from my side

Areas for Opponent Improvement:
- Could have saved one card for next round
- Might have over-committed to the all-in strategy

This round demonstrated the razor's edge between aggression and defense in high-level play. While both players showed mastery, the early defensive positioning with Reinforce proved to be the deciding factor."

YOUR STATUS: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Quake
    Your strategy: In this critical situation with both players at low HP, Quake's P2 priority is crucial. At 1/7 HP, I need fast, reliable effects that can't be easily disrupted. While Aftershocks and Crepuscule are powerful, their P5 priority and Conjury status make them too risky - they could be cancelled before resolving. Crush's P3 weaken effect is good but slightly too slow. Quake at P2 will resolve before most responses and can potentially secure the win before the opponent's spell resolves.
  Clash 2: YOU played Crush
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires aggressive play. Crush at P3 is the optimal choice because: 1) It's faster than the other options (P3 vs P5), ensuring it resolves before potential lethal damage 2) The Weaken 1 effect can permanently reduce enemy's max HP, making them more vulnerable 3) Aftershocks and Crepuscule being Conjuries are too risky at 1 HP since they can be cancelled easily 4) With Quake already active, maintaining earth pressure is strategically sound

  "analysis": "Let's break down this critical round that led to victory through precise priority manipulation and risk assessment:

KEY WINNING DECISIONS:
1. Choosing Quake (P2) over higher damage but riskier Conjury spells was crucial. Against a wounded opponent, securing guaranteed damage through faster priority was more important than potentially higher but cancellable damage.

2. Following up with Crush (P3) demonstrated strong priority sequencing. The weaken effect created additional pressure while maintaining the earth element advantage.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Playing Grow (Wood) in this situation was suboptimal. While it provides healing, its slower priority meant it wouldn't save them from faster damage sources. A defensive P2 spell would have been better.

2. Agonize (Venom) shows they were trying to pressure our health, but without proper priority protection, they couldn't establish board control.

TECHNICAL EXECUTION:
The victory came through understanding priority windows. By playing P2 into P3, we created a sequence that:
- Resolved before opponent's slower spells
- Maintained element pressure
- Avoided vulnerability to cancellation
- Created compound pressure through damage + weaken

This demonstrates the core grandmaster principle: Victory often comes not from raw damage output, but from controlling the priority stack and forcing opponents to play reactively rather than proactively.

LEARNING POINT:
When at critical health thresholds, priority becomes more important than raw effect power. A guaranteed P2 damage spell is often better than a potentially stronger but slower or more vulnerable option."

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Aftershocks
    Your strategy: Aftershocks is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The opponent is at critical health (2/5 HP) and Aftershocks deals 2 damage, which would force a trunk loss. 2) While it's a Conjury that could be cancelled, its Priority 5 means most cancels would need to happen at P1-P4, requiring specific responses. 3) Even if cancelled, it forces the opponent to use resources defending rather than setting up their own win condition. 4) If it resolves, the advance effects provide ongoing value in future clashes. The alternative Crepuscule is also P5 but doesn't threaten lethal, while our P1/P2 options don't provide immediate pressure on their low health.
  Clash 2: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: This is a critical moment with several key factors: 1) The opponent is at 2/5 HP with Overexert active, making them vulnerable 2) I have Aftershocks active which can deal damage 3) Coalesce at P1 will resolve before most effects and can advance other spells. Coalesce's Priority 1 timing and advance effects synergize perfectly with Aftershocks, potentially setting up lethal damage. While Accelerator is also P1, being a Conjury makes it vulnerable to cancellation. Crepuscule is too slow at P5, and Clap at P2 doesn't provide the same strategic advantage as Coalesce's P1 timing.
  Clash 3: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: This is a critical clash where timing is everything. The enemy is at 1 HP and I already have Aftershocks and Coalesce active. Accelerator (P1) is the perfect choice here because:

1. As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything else, letting me manipulate the timing of my active spells
2. Being a Conjury doesn't matter much since the enemy is focused on survival at 1 HP
3. The advance effects will help set up future clashes if needed
4. Most importantly, it will accelerate my Aftershocks, which combined with Coalesce's boost should be enough to secure the kill before the enemy can respond

Clap would be too slow at P2, and Crepuscule at P5 would give the enemy too much time to respond. The P1 timing of Accelerator is crucial here.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterclass in priority manipulation and spell synergy that showcased high-level Elemental Elephants strategy:

1. Opening Setup (Clash 1):
- The Aftershocks play was textbook pressure application - forcing the opponent to either answer it or face guaranteed trunk loss
- As a P5 Conjury, it gave the opponent a window to cancel, but they'd have to spend resources defensively rather than developing their position

2. The Kill Setup (Clash 2):
- Coalesce was the critical piece, demonstrating deep understanding of priority mechanics
- P1 timing meant it would resolve before most defensive options
- The advance effect on Aftershocks created a powerful damage engine

3. The Finishing Sequence (Clash 3):
- Accelerator completed a devastating priority chain: P1 Accelerator → P1 Coalesce → Aftershocks damage
- This created an almost unstoppable damage sequence that's very difficult to answer without specific counter-spells

Key Learning Points:
1. Priority stacking - showing how multiple P1 spells can create devastating combinations
2. Resource management - each spell served multiple purposes (damage + advance effects)
3. Win condition protection - using multiple threats meant opponent needed multiple answers

The opponent's limited hand size (1 card) suggests they may have overcommitted resources earlier, leaving them vulnerable to this multi-spell combination. In future games, they should consider:
- Maintaining defensive options against P5 Conjuries
- Managing hand size to have answers for critical moments
- Recognizing when to trade resources to prevent lethal setups

This round demonstrates why Earth/Time/Twilight is considered one of the strongest elemental combinations, particularly for its ability to create these kinds of priority-based kill sequences."

[SAVANT] Round 7 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 7 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Break
    Your strategy: Playing Break (P1 Thunder boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent might play, giving us initiative 2) Break's advance effects will continue providing value in future clashes 3) Holding Stupefy and Clap (both P2 Thunder spells) gives us strong follow-up options 4) Crepuscule is too risky as a Conjury that could be cancelled 5) With both players at 5/5 HP and 2 trunks, establishing early board control is crucial
  Clash 2: YOU played Stupefy
    Your strategy: Choosing Stupefy (Thunder attack/response) as a P2 play here is optimal for several reasons: 1) With Break already active, my Thunder spells get enhanced. 2) The P2 priority means I can potentially disrupt any slower plays. 3) Stupefy's response effects could be valuable given the enemy's Encumber. 4) I want to maintain pressure while both of us are at 5 HP with 2 trunks - this is a critical juncture. 5) Saving Crepuscule (Conjury) for a more protected setup would be wiser since it's vulnerable to cancellation.
  Clash 3: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Choosing Clap (Thunder P2) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Break and Stupefy already active, adding another Thunder spell strengthens our elemental synergy. 2) The P2 priority ensures it resolves quickly, which is crucial since the enemy is at 3 HP and we want to capitalize on our advantage. 3) Its boost and advance capabilities give us flexibility for the final clash. 4) Crepuscule as a P5 Conjury is too slow and risky, while Eventide doesn't provide the immediate pressure we need.
  Clash 4: YOU played Crepuscule
    Your strategy: Playing Crepuscule is the optimal choice here. While it's a P5 Conjury that could be vulnerable to cancellation, the enemy has no obvious way to cancel it with their active spells. The enemy is at 3 HP and we have multiple Thunder spells active (Break, Stupefy, Clap) which could provide significant damage synergy. Crepuscule's complex effects combined with our Thunder suite could potentially close out the match this clash. Eventide's P2 timing, while faster, doesn't provide the same game-ending potential.

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Opening with Reinforce (Metal remedy, P2) is a strong proactive play. As a P2 spell, it resolves very early and bolsters our max HP to 6, giving us more strategic flexibility for the entire round. This creates a health buffer that makes our future plays safer and forces the opponent to commit more resources to threaten our trunks. It also protects against potential early aggression since most damage spells are P3 or slower.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Selecting Agonize (P3 Venom) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Break active, the enemy likely plans to follow up with damage - Agonize's P3 will resolve before most heavy attacks. 2) The advance effect gives ongoing value. 3) Enemy is at 5/5 HP - getting early damage in is valuable. 4) Reinforce is already providing defensive value, so we can focus on offense. 5) Keeping higher priority cards like Encumber (P2) available for later defensive needs is strategic.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber (P2) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) Its high P2 priority lets it resolve before most spells, which is crucial given the enemy has two Thunder spells active that could be setting up a combo. 2) Being a Venom spell, it synergizes with our active Agonize. 3) Having advance effects gives us continued value into the final clash. 4) The enemy is at 5/5 HP - we don't need immediate damage from Enfeeble/Besiege since we're setting up for a stronger finish. 5) While Defend could heal us, we're still at healthy 5/6 HP and need to maintain offensive pressure.
  Clash 4: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: Choosing Defend (Metal remedy) is optimal here for several reasons:
1. We're at 5/6 HP and healing will maintain our health advantage
2. Enemy has multiple Thunder spells active which suggests aggressive potential
3. Priority 3 will resolve before their Priority 4-5 attacks
4. Metal synergy with our active Reinforce spell
5. Response/boost effects could be valuable going into next round

Enfeeble or Besiege would be less effective since we already have strong offensive pressure from active Agonize and Encumber. Better to shore up defenses.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "Let me break down this round from a grandmaster perspective:

  STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES GAINED:
  - We've established a powerful board state with 2 key Venom spells (Agonize + Encumber) providing continuous pressure
  - Our max HP advantage (6 vs 5) from early Reinforce gives us more strategic flexibility
  - We're maintaining card advantage (only used 4 cards vs opponent's 5)
  
  OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
  1. Over-committed to Thunder element (Break, Clap, Stupefy) making their strategy predictable
  2. Failed to address our Reinforce, allowing the max HP differential to persist
  3. Their Thunder-heavy approach suggests burst damage strategy, but spreading across 3 clashes diluted its impact

  OUR STRONG POINTS:
  1. Element diversity (Metal/Venom mix) gives us tactical flexibility
  2. Prioritized early max HP advantage with Reinforce
  3. Built sustainable pressure through advance effects
  4. Maintained defensive options while establishing offensive presence

  KEY DECISION POINT:
  The Clash 3 Encumber play was particularly strong - it exploited the opponent's Thunder commitment by getting under their priority while adding to our Venom synergy. This created a 'lose-lose' situation where they either:
  - Play aggressively and risk getting their spells disrupted
  - Play defensively and allow our advance effects to accumulate

  LOOKING AHEAD:
  We're in an excellent position with:
  - HP advantage (5/6 vs 5/5)
  - Two advance effects active
  - Strong element diversity
  - Better card economy

  The opponent will need to find answers to both our Venom pressure and Metal defensive capabilities in the next round. Their Thunder commitment may limit their options."

=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Choosing Agonize (P3 Venom attack) for several strategic reasons: 1) Its Priority 3 gives us a speed advantage over the P4 options while still dealing damage, 2) With both players at near-full health, getting early damage through is valuable, 3) Holding Reinforce (P2) gives us a strong defensive option for later clashes if needed, 4) The advance effects on Agonize could provide additional value in subsequent clashes, and 5) We want to maintain pressure while we have a health advantage (5/6 vs 5/5)
  Clash 2: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: Selecting Reinforce (Metal remedy, P2) for several strategic reasons:

1. Health Management: Currently at 5/6 HP with enemy at 5/5. Bolstering now to 6/7 creates a significant health advantage.

2. Priority Advantage: P2 resolves before enemy's likely P3-P4 plays, ensuring the bolster effect happens.

3. Defensive Setup: With Agonize active and potentially threatening plays coming, increasing max HP provides better survivability.

4. Saving Attacks: Both Enfeeble and Besiege could be more valuable later when combined with Agonize's effects or when enemy is more vulnerable.

5. Resource Efficiency: Remedy spells often provide better value than single-point damage attacks when health totals are close.
  Clash 3: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble (Venom) for several strategic reasons: 1) It synergizes with my active Agonize, potentially setting up stronger venom interactions 2) Both options are P4 attacks that deal 1 damage, but Enfeeble's advance effects align better with my current board state 3) The enemy is at 4/5 HP - keeping pressure with consistent damage while building venom synergies is optimal 4) With Break active, being prepared for Thunder interactions is important, and Enfeeble gives more flexibility
  Clash 4: YOU played Besiege
    Your strategy: Playing Besiege here is a strong tactical choice. With the enemy at 3/5 HP, even 1 damage is meaningful. More importantly, Besiege's advance effects will carry forward, potentially setting up stronger plays next round. The enemy has multiple active boosts (Break, Daybreak, Coalesce) which suggests they're building toward something - getting our own boost in play helps counter that setup. The P4 timing also works well with our active Reinforce and Enfeeble.

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and resource management that gave us a clear advantage. Let's break down the key elements:

HEALTH ADVANTAGE SECURED:
- We're at 5/7 HP vs their 3/5 HP
- The early Agonize into Reinforce sequence was particularly strong, allowing us to both deal damage and increase our health buffer
- This health gap will force them to play more aggressively next round, which we can exploit

STRATEGIC WINS:
1. Priority Management
- Our P2 Reinforce was perfectly timed to bolster before their attacks
- We maintained consistent pressure with well-timed P3-P4 plays

2. Element Synergy
- Built strong Venom synergy with Agonize + Enfeeble
- Established Metal presence with both Reinforce and Besiege

3. Board Control
- We have 3 active spells vs their 4
- Our actives (Reinforce, Enfeeble, Besiege) provide both defensive and offensive options
- Their Twilight-heavy board (3 Twilight spells) suggests they're building toward a specific combo

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Over-investment in Twilight setup (Daybreak, Coalesce, Eventide)
- This leaves them vulnerable to aggressive plays next round
- Too much focus on future value while falling behind on health

2. Insufficient Health Management
- Failed to adequately protect their health pool, now at critical 3/5

NEXT ROUND IMPLICATIONS:
- They'll likely need to play aggressively to overcome the health deficit
- Our active Metal/Venom synergies give us flexibility in responses
- Their Twilight setup could enable powerful plays, but they're racing against their low health

Overall, we've established a commanding position through superior resource management and strategic timing. The opponent's heavy investment in Twilight setup may prove costly given their health situation."

=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Root
    Your strategy: Playing Root (P1 Nectar Conjury) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) Its P1 priority gives us first action, critical when the opponent is at low HP and likely to play aggressively. 2) As a Conjury, it can bait out removal, protecting our other powerful cards. 3) The advance effects will provide ongoing value across multiple clashes. 4) We have Punishment as a strong follow-up if Root survives. 5) Holding Absorb gives us defensive options if needed.
  Clash 2: YOU played Absorb
    Your strategy: Choosing Absorb (Nectar remedy) as the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With Root active, we're well positioned for Nectar synergies 2) At P2, Absorb will resolve before most attacks, potentially gaining life before taking damage 3) The enemy's Crush is still active, suggesting they may try to capitalize on it - Absorb helps protect against that 4) At 5/7 HP, we want to maintain our health advantage rather than risk a more aggressive play with Punishment (which is also vulnerable as a Conjury) 5) Encumber could be useful but doesn't provide immediate value like Absorb can
  Clash 3: YOU played Punishment
    Your strategy: Playing Punishment here is a strong strategic choice. With the enemy at 3/5 HP and my active Root spell, I can set up a potential lethal sequence. While Punishment is a conjury (vulnerable to being cancelled), it advances to the next clash and can combine with Root's ongoing effects. Even if it gets cancelled, forcing the opponent to deal with it diverts their resources. The P5 timing means it resolves after most effects, which can be advantageous for seeing how the clash plays out first.

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of strategic positioning and element control. Let's break down the key aspects:

STRATEGIC STRENGTHS:
1. Opening with Root (P1) was tactically brilliant:
   - Established early Nectar control
   - Forced opponent to choose between removing Root or developing their own strategy
   - Created ongoing value through advances

2. Absorb timing was perfect:
   - Protected against their active Crush
   - Maintained health advantage at 5/7
   - Demonstrated strong defensive awareness

3. Element Synergy:
   - Full Nectar package (Root, Absorb, Punishment)
   - Created compounding effects and pressure

OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
1. Element Dispersion:
   - Mixed Earth (Crush, Quake) and Thunder (Clap)
   - Lacked cohesive strategy across elements
   - Could have focused on single element for stronger synergies

2. Positioning:
   - Failed to effectively counter our Root opening
   - Allowed us to establish and maintain board control

CRITICAL DECISION POINT:
The Clash 2 Absorb play was particularly decisive. While they had Crush active, we preemptively protected our health pool, maintaining pressure while staying safe. This demonstrates high-level understanding of health threshold management.

LEARNING OPPORTUNITY:
For the opponent, this round highlights the importance of element commitment. When facing a focused Nectar strategy, splitting between Earth and Thunder reduced their ability to generate meaningful pressure or synergies.

This round showcases why Nectar is considered one of the most powerful elements when played correctly - it creates cascading advantages that are difficult to overcome without a focused counter-strategy."

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Imitate
    Your strategy: Imitate at P1 is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) Enemy is at critical health (2/5) making them likely to play defensively with heals or responses. Imitate can copy their defensive tools against them. 2) P1 priority means we act first, giving us maximum flexibility to react to their play. 3) If they do try an aggressive play, we can potentially turn it back on them for lethal damage. 4) Saving Familiar and Sap maintains strong defensive options for later clashes.
  Clash 2: YOU played Familiar
    Your strategy: Playing Familiar here is optimal for several reasons: 1) With both players having Accelerator active, priority manipulation is crucial 2) At P3, Familiar gives us attack potential while maintaining flexibility 3) The enemy is at 2 HP - if they play defensively, Familiar's response effects could be valuable, while if they're aggressive, we can pivot to defense 4) Sap at P2 is tempting, but could leave us vulnerable, while Defend is too passive given our advantageous position

  "analysis": "Let's break down this critical Round 4 position from a grandmaster perspective:

Strategic Dynamics:
- We've maintained strong board presence with multiple active spells (Imitate, Accelerator, Familiar)
- Our health position is solid at 4/7 while holding all 3 trunks
- Opponent is in a precarious position with 2 trunks and 5/5 HP

Key Decision Points:

1. Imitate (P1) in Clash 1:
- This was a masterful pressure play that demonstrates high-level priority manipulation
- By leading with P1 Imitate, we forced opponent into a defensive posture
- The Shadow element choice shows advanced understanding of element coverage

2. Familiar (P3) in Clash 2:
- Excellent tempo play that maintained pressure while providing defensive options
- With Accelerator active, the P3 timing was particularly potent
- Shows advanced understanding of priority layering

Areas of Excellence:
- Priority sequencing with multiple active spells
- Resource conservation (still holding 2 cards)
- Maintaining trunk advantage through careful health management

Opponent Analysis:
- They've struggled to maintain board presence
- Loss of a trunk indicates they've been forced into reactive rather than proactive plays
- Their compressed health range (5/5) makes them vulnerable to burst damage

Looking Forward:
- With 2 cards in hand vs opponent's 2, we have resource parity
- Our active spell advantage gives us significant strategic flexibility
- Primary win condition appears to be through careful pressure while maintaining our defensive position

This round demonstrates mastery of advanced concepts like priority manipulation, resource management, and strategic positioning. The opponent will need to find creative answers to our established board presence to avoid further trunk loss."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/8 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 2: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: This is a critical defensive position that calls for Reinforce (P2 Bolster 1). Here's why:

1) We're at 4/7 HP with active Defend, while opponent is at 5/5 with Stupefy. We need to shore up our defenses.

2) Bolstering now is perfect timing because:
- It's P2, so it resolves before most attacks
- We already have Defend active for protection
- Increasing our max HP gives more buffer for future clashes

3) Both attack options (Enfeeble and Besiege) are P4, which is too slow and risky given the enemy's Stupefy could punish aggressive plays.

4) Reinforce synergizes with our active Defend spell, creating a strong defensive foundation that can help us outlast the opponent who is down a trunk.
  Clash 3: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Choosing Enfeeble over Besiege for several key reasons: 1) With Break and Stupefy active, the opponent is likely setting up for a Thunder combo finish. Enfeeble's venom typing disrupts that elemental synergy. 2) My Defend and Reinforce provide good defensive coverage, so I can afford to play more aggressively. 3) Both spells deal 1 damage, but Enfeeble's advance effects will be more valuable against their remaining trunk as they're likely to play defensively next clash. 4) At 5/5 HP, dealing 1 damage now puts them in a more vulnerable position for the final clash.
  Clash 4: YOU played Besiege
    Your strategy: Playing Besiege is the optimal choice here. At 4/8 HP with active Defend and Reinforce, I'm well protected. The enemy is at 4/5 HP with 2 trunks and has offensive spells active. Besiege will deal 1 damage, potentially bringing them to 3 HP. More importantly, being a P4 spell with advance effects, it will carry forward to the next round, giving me early pressure. While they have Break and Agonize active which could be threatening, my defensive setup with Defend and Reinforce provides adequate protection. The advance effect of Besiege creates ongoing value that could help secure a trunk advantage.

  "analysis": "This was a fascinating round that showcased both strategic depth and the importance of spell timing. Let's break down the key moments:

STRONG PLAYS:
1. Our defensive foundation with Defend + Reinforce (P2) proved crucial, effectively increasing our survivability while maintaining board presence.
2. The Enfeeble play in Clash 3 was particularly strong, disrupting their Thunder synergy while advancing to maintain pressure.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Their Stupefy + Break combo telegraphed a Thunder strategy too obviously, allowing us to counter with Enfeeble's Venom typing.
2. Playing Repeater in the final clash was suboptimal - it's a setup spell that would have been more valuable earlier in the round.

CRITICAL POSITION ANALYSIS:
- We're at 3/8 HP with 3 trunks vs their 4/5 HP with 2 trunks
- Our spell advantage is significant: We have 4 active spells vs their 4
- The type diversity of our active spells (Metal/Venom) gives us better coverage

LOOKING AHEAD:
The position strongly favors us despite the lower current HP because:
1. We have a trunk advantage
2. Our higher max HP (8) provides more flexibility
3. Both Enfeeble and Besiege have advance effects, giving us initiative

Key learning: The early defensive investment (Defend + Reinforce) created a foundation that allowed more aggressive plays later, demonstrating the importance of proper setup in high-level play."

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/5 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Playing Encumber (P2) is the optimal choice here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 4/5 HP and 2 trunks, they are vulnerable and likely to play defensively. Encumber's P2 priority lets us potentially disrupt their defenses. 2) The advance effects will provide ongoing value. 3) At 3/8 HP ourselves, we need to be careful about taking damage - Encumber's priority gives us better odds of resolving before potential attacks. 4) Turbulence would be risky since P4 is slow and enemy could counter, while Gust doesn't provide immediate impact we need in this critical position.
  Clash 2: YOU played Turbulence
    Your strategy: Turbulence is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P4, it will resolve before any potential PA advance effects, 2) With the enemy at 4 HP, the 3+1 damage potential could secure a trunk loss if they don't have protection, 3) My Encumber is already active which could help disrupt their plans, and 4) Both Blow and Gust being advance priority spells are less impactful when we need immediate pressure.
  Clash 3: YOU played Blow
    Your strategy: Choosing Blow is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 3 HP and their active Crush spell, we need to maintain control while setting up lethal damage. Blow can advance our active Turbulence, which is crucial since Turbulence has a response effect that deals 2 damage when the enemy plays an attack spell. The enemy has already committed Crush (an attack), so advancing Turbulence ensures we'll get the response trigger next clash, potentially dealing the final 2 damage needed to remove another trunk. While Gust could also advance spells, Blow is more efficient for our current board state.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Turbulence (Wind)
  - YOUR Blow (Wind)
  - YOUR Encumber (Venom)

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong tactical execution and strategic depth from both sides. Let's analyze the key moments:

STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS:
1. Opening with Encumber (P2) proved highly effective:
- Disrupted opponent's options through discard effects
- Created ongoing pressure that limited their plays
- Established early board control at a crucial health threshold

2. Turbulence + Blow Combination:
- Used Turbulence's response damage potential (3+1)
- Blow's advance effect created guaranteed value
- Forced opponent into difficult decisions with active Encumber

OPPONENT'S PLAY ANALYSIS:
- Their Daybreak + Crush combination showed good understanding of priority sequencing
- However, they may have overcommitted resources given their trunk situation
- Could have played more conservatively at 2 trunks remaining

CRITICAL POSITION:
Current state (3/6 HP vs 3/5 HP) with trunk advantage (3-2) puts us in a commanding position. The active spell advantage (3 vs 2) further reinforces our control.

KEY LEARNINGS:
- Priority manipulation through Encumber into Turbulence created powerful tempo
- Wind element's advance effects demonstrated strong synergy
- Board control through active spells proved more valuable than direct damage

The round showcased high-level spell sequencing and resource management. Our opponent showed skill but ultimately fell behind in the resource race, particularly in trunk preservation."

=== ROUND 7 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 1/7 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Root
    Your strategy: Selecting Root (P1 Nectar Conjury) for several strategic reasons: 1) At P1, it resolves first which is crucial when both players are at low HP 2) As a Conjury, it has powerful advance effects that can help control future clashes 3) The opponent is at 3 HP with 2 trunks - they may play defensively, making Root's advance effects valuable 4) While it could be cancelled, forcing the opponent to use resources to cancel it is still advantageous 5) The other options are either too slow (Slumber P5, Bedim P4) or don't provide immediate threat pressure (Nightglow P2)
  Clash 2: YOU played Nightglow
    Your strategy: Selecting Nightglow (P2) for several critical reasons: 1) Its priority 2 is crucial - it will resolve before most spells, allowing the bolster effect to potentially save us from lethal damage 2) We're at a dangerous 3 HP, and increasing our max health creates more buffer 3) With Root active, we want to avoid using slower P4-P5 spells that could be punished. The bolster effect is permanent and can't be cancelled once it resolves, making it more reliable than healing in this tense situation.
  Clash 3: YOU played Bedim
    Your strategy: Playing Bedim here is optimal for several reasons: 1) With Nightglow and Root active, we want to maintain pressure while the enemy is at low health. 2) Bedim's P4 timing means it resolves after most responses but before advances, making it harder to counter. 3) The 1 damage could be crucial with enemy at 3 HP. 4) The advance effect synergizes with our active Moonshine spells for future clash potential. 5) Most importantly, we need to secure damage before enemy potentially recovers or sets up defenses.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Nightglow (Moonshine)
  - YOUR Root (Nectar)

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of attrition warfare that showcased the power of priority manipulation and spell synergies. Let's break down the key moments:

KEY STRATEGIC ELEMENTS:
1. Opening with Root (P1) was critical - it forced the opponent to respect the Conjury threat while maintaining priority advantage. They had to commit resources to deal with it or risk its powerful advance effects.

2. The Nightglow play in Clash 2 proved decisive. The permanent bolster effect increased our maximum health, which became crucial when we lost health but maintained trunk control. This demonstrates the value of preventive measures over reactive healing.

3. The opponent's sequence of Gravitate → Quake → Clap → Impact showed good technical execution, but revealed a strategic weakness: they committed too heavily to damage without securing board control first.

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
- Over-committed to direct damage without establishing priority control
- Failed to anticipate the Nightglow bolster effect which prevented a trunk break
- Could have better managed their card economy for the late game

INNOVATIVE ELEMENTS:
The Moonshine/Nectar combination (Root + Nightglow + Bedim) demonstrated an advanced understanding of element synergy. While not commonly seen, this combination provides both immediate pressure and long-term value through advance effects.

CURRENT POSITION:
At 1/7 HP vs 2/5 HP with trunk advantage (3-2), we're in a strong position despite the low health. The higher maximum health (7) gives us more recovery potential, while maintaining all three trunks provides strategic flexibility.

LEARNING POINT:
This round perfectly illustrates why health manipulation (bolster/weaken) can be more valuable than direct damage in certain scenarios. The permanent nature of these effects creates lasting advantages that can decide games."

YOUR STATUS: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 2/5 HP, 2 trunks, 4 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Overexert
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires P1 play. At 1 HP and enemy at 2 HP, Overexert's P1 priority gives best chance to secure kill before opponent can respond. While risky due to self-damage, securing enemy trunk loss takes priority. Other options too slow - enemy likely has lethal at P2/P3 given their previous plays.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a pivotal round with extremely high stakes. Let's analyze the critical decision points:

STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
- Both players at 2 trunks - every HP matters
- Enemy at 2/5 HP makes them vulnerable
- Accelerator on board means they likely plan tempo plays

KEY DECISION - OVEREXERT PLAY:
- Masterful use of P1 priority to force action before opponent
- Self-damage risk justified by need to secure trunk advantage
- Demonstrates deep understanding of priority system
- Recognized kill window and executed without hesitation

OPPONENT'S POSITION:
1. Leaving Accelerator exposed was a critical error
2. At 2 HP, they needed defensive options ready
3. Having 4 cards but no protection suggests poor hand management

LEARNING POINTS:
- When at low HP, P1 spells become exponentially more valuable
- Accelerator without protection creates vulnerability
- Sometimes taking self-damage is correct if it secures positional advantage

This round showcases high-level priority manipulation and risk assessment. The opponent needs to improve their defensive positioning and spell sequencing to prevent such decisive P1 punishes.

A grandmaster-level play requires recognizing not just the immediate damage potential, but understanding how priority systems can be leveraged to force advantageous situations. This was textbook execution."

[SAVANT] Round 9 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 9 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 3/7 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 1/2 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Absorb
    Your strategy: Absorb (P2 Nectar remedy/response) is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy is at 2/5 HP, making them vulnerable but also desperate - they're likely to play aggressively to try to take one of my trunks. 2) Absorb's P2 priority will let me respond to most attacks before they hit. 3) If they do attack, I can potentially heal and gain card advantage. 4) My 6/6 HP position is strong - I want to maintain this advantage rather than risk a risky offensive play. 5) Punishment (Conjury) is too vulnerable right now, Offering/Ritual are too slow, and Imitate is better saved for when I have a clearer read on their strategy.
  Clash 2: YOU played Imitate
    Your strategy: Playing Imitate (Shadow, P1) is the optimal choice here for several reasons:

1. At P1, it resolves before enemy's Stupefy and our own active Absorb
2. With enemy at 2 HP and having Stupefy active, they're likely setting up for a finishing move
3. Imitate's P1 priority gives us the ability to potentially copy and redirect threats
4. The other options are riskier - Punishment is vulnerable as a Conjury, Offering and Ritual don't provide immediate protection
5. Shadow element gives unpredictability in our response

This defensive play protects us while maintaining board control and keeping our HP advantage.
  Clash 3: YOU played Ritual
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where we need to secure the win. The enemy is at 1 HP with Stupefy active. Ritual at P3 is the perfect choice here because:
1. It will resolve before their Stupefy (if it triggers)
2. The enemy is extremely vulnerable at 1 HP, so we just need to ensure damage connects
3. Ritual's advance effect will carry forward to next clash if needed
4. Offering at P4 would be too slow and risky
5. Punishment as a Conjury could be cancelled and is too slow at P5
  Clash 4: YOU played Punishment
    Your strategy: This is a critical endgame position where we need to secure victory. The enemy is at 1 HP and has Stupefy + Scorch active. Punishment is the safer play here compared to Offering for several reasons: 1) Being P5, it resolves after most spells, guaranteeing the 1 damage can finish off the opponent before they recover 2) It's less likely to be disrupted by Stupefy's response effect 3) If it survives, its advance effects could be valuable if the game continues. While being a Conjury makes it vulnerable, the opponent likely needs their damage to stay alive rather than cancel our spell.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a fascinating round that showcased high-level strategic play and ultimately some critical mistakes on my part that led to a vulnerable position.

Key Strategic Points:

1. Opening with Absorb (P2) was theoretically sound as defensive positioning, but I failed to account for the opponent's ability to stack multiple damage sources. This illustrates the principle that sometimes pure defense isn't enough against a coordinated assault.

2. The Imitate play in clash 2 was technically correct but ultimately ineffective. While P1 priority was valuable, I didn't maximize its potential by forcing advantageous copies. This shows how even correct card choices can be suboptimal if not timed perfectly with clear targets.

3. My critical mistake came in clashes 3-4: I became too focused on trying to deal the final point of damage rather than protecting my position. With multiple enemy spells active (Stupefy, Scorch), playing Ritual into Punishment left me extremely vulnerable.

Opponent's Strong Plays:
- Excellent use of spell stacking with Stupefy + Scorch + Fireball
- Smart preservation of key cards while maintaining pressure
- Demonstrated mastery of priority sequencing to maximize damage potential

Learning Points:
1. Don't get tunnel-visioned on dealing damage when your own position is precarious
2. Better tracking of opponent's active effects could have prevented overextension
3. Sometimes it's better to play defensively for multiple turns rather than trying to force a finish

Current Position (3/7 HP, 2 trunks vs 1/2 HP, 2 trunks) is much more dangerous than the numbers suggest due to active spells. This illustrates how raw HP numbers don't tell the full strategic story.

A grandmaster-level play would have been to focus more on neutralizing active threats before attempting to close out the game. This round serves as an excellent example of how even strong theoretical plays need to account for the full board state."

[SAVANT] Round 10 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 10 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/7 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/4 HP, 1 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Selecting Accelerator is the optimal play here. With the enemy at just 1 HP and 2 trunks, they are extremely vulnerable. Accelerator's P1 priority ensures it resolves first, and as a boost with advance effects, it can help set up powerful combinations in subsequent clashes. While we're at low HP ourselves (3/7), healing isn't the immediate priority since forcing a trunk loss on the opponent is more strategically valuable. The Conjury aspect makes it vulnerable to cancellation, but it's worth the risk given the potential payoff.
  Clash 2: YOU played Flow
    Your strategy: Flow is the optimal choice here for several key reasons: 1) The enemy is at critical health (1 HP) and likely to play defensively, making aggressive plays less valuable 2) With Accelerator active, we need to maintain pressure while healing safely 3) Flow's advance effects will help us maintain board presence into future clashes 4) At P3, it resolves at the same time as other likely defensive plays the opponent might make
  Clash 3: YOU played Cleanse
    Your strategy: Cleanse is the optimal play here for multiple reasons: 1) Enemy is at 1 HP with Break and Agonize active - Cleanse can both deal damage to finish them off AND remove their active effects. 2) While Nourish's heal is tempting at 3/7 HP, removing enemy boosts is more valuable since it prevents future value. 3) Familiar would be risky since enemy response effects could punish it. Cleanse provides the cleanest path to securing a trunk while neutralizing threats.

  "analysis": "This round demonstrated strong technical play but also revealed some key strategic oversights:

  STRENGTHS:
  - Opening with Accelerator was correct, establishing early tempo advantage
  - The Flow + Accelerator combination created powerful pressure
  - Card sequencing was logically sound given the priority system

  CRITICAL MISTAKES:
  - We ended up at dangerously low HP (2/7) which puts us in a precarious position
  - Our Cleanse play, while theoretically sound, didn't achieve the intended trunk pressure
  - We may have over-committed to offensive plays without sufficient defensive backup

  OPPONENT'S PLAY:
  - They demonstrated excellent defensive positioning, maintaining their last trunk despite pressure
  - Successfully navigated from 1 HP back to 4 HP shows strong recovery skills
  - Their resource management appears superior as they've maintained hand parity

  KEY LEARNINGS:
  1. When holding priority advantage, we must ensure it translates to actual board impact
  2. Against a single-trunk opponent, sustaining our own health is equally important as applying pressure
  3. The Accelerator + Flow combination, while powerful, consumed significant resources without securing a win condition

  POSITION ASSESSMENT:
  We're in a challenging position at 2/7 HP. While we have two trunks to their one, our low health makes us vulnerable to any burst damage. The next round will require extremely careful play, likely prioritizing healing or defensive options if available in our draw."

=== ROUND 11 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/4 HP, 1 trunks, 3 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Reinforce
    Your strategy: With 2/7 HP and the enemy at 4/4 HP on their last trunk, this is a critical decision point. While healing with Nourish might seem tempting, Reinforce's bolster effect is strategically superior here. Here's why:

1. Bolstering increases our max HP permanently, which persists even if we lose a trunk
2. At Priority 2, it's fast enough to resolve before most attacks
3. The enemy being on their last trunk means they're likely to play aggressively - having a higher max HP gives us more buffer
4. We still have healing options like Nourish and Defend for later clashes

This play sets us up better for the long game while still providing immediate value through the increased max HP.
  Clash 2: YOU played Defend
    Your strategy: Selecting Defend is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At 2 HP, I need healing to survive, but Nourish would leave me vulnerable to future attacks 2) Defend not only heals 1 HP but has advance effects that can protect me in future clashes 3) The P3 priority means it will resolve before most attacks but after quick responses 4) With the enemy at 1 trunk, they'll likely play aggressively, making defensive positioning crucial 5) Metal synergy with active Reinforce spell could be relevant
  Clash 3: YOU played Nourish
    Your strategy: Critical healing needed at 2 HP. Nourish (P3) will heal me to 4 HP, which is much safer given I have 2 trunks to protect. While Sap has a better priority, healing is the clear priority here. Enfeeble is too slow at P4 and the 1 damage isn't impactful enough against opponent's single trunk. With Reinforce and Defend active, I want to leverage my defensive positioning by restoring health.
  Clash 4: YOU played Sap
    Your strategy: Sap is the optimal choice here for several critical reasons: 1) With P2, it resolves before most spells, allowing us to potentially disrupt the opponent's strategy 2) The enemy has Crush active which could be devastating - we need every tool to survive 3) Enfeeble's P4 would be too slow to help if we're in danger 4) Our health at 4/6 means we need to play defensively since losing this trunk would be devastating while the enemy only has 1 trunk left 4) We have multiple remedy spells active providing sustain, so focusing on control/disruption makes more sense than adding another slow attack

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful defensive round that showcased high-level strategic positioning. Let's break it down:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. HEALTH MANAGEMENT: Starting at 2/7 HP, we executed a perfect recovery sequence:
   - Reinforce (bolster) → Defend (heal + advance) → Nourish (heal) → Sap (control)
   - This brought us to 4/6 HP while maintaining defensive pressure

2. PRIORITY MANIPULATION:
   - Used P2-P3 spells predominantly to stay ahead of potential attacks
   - Sap (P2) in final clash was particularly strong against their active Crush

3. SPELL SYNERGY:
   - Metal synergy between Reinforce and Defend created a strong defensive core
   - Mixed in Water (Nourish) and Shadow (Sap) for versatility

Our Opponent's Position:
- They're on their last trunk at 4/4 HP
- Their Crush setup shows aggressive intent
- Daybreak indicates they're trying to maintain board presence

Critical Decision Point:
The most important play was choosing Reinforce over immediate healing in Clash 1. While risky at 2 HP, it set up our entire defensive strategy and showed high-level understanding of health breakpoints.

Areas for Improvement:
- Could potentially have saved Sap for next round's opening clash
- Might have overcommitted to defense if opponent was sandbagging cards

Overall, this was textbook control play against an opponent on their last trunk. We maintained defensive pressure while steadily improving our position, forcing them to play into our defensive setup."

[SAVANT] Round 12 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 12 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 4/4 HP, 1 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Turbulence
    Your strategy: This is a critical position where the opponent is down to their last trunk with 4 HP. Turbulence offers immediate high damage potential (3 damage + 1 damage) at P4. While it's slower than Starfall, the higher damage output is worth it since dealing 4 damage would eliminate their final trunk. The opponent likely expects safer plays like Starfall or setup plays like Gleam, making Turbulence potentially surprising. Additionally, keeping Gleam and other advance-capable cards for later clashes gives more strategic options.
  Clash 2: YOU played Starfall
    Your strategy: Starfall is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With P3, it's fast enough to potentially deal crucial damage before enemy responses 2) The enemy is at 3/4 HP with only one trunk - any damage pressure is valuable 3) Starfall's advance effects will provide continued value in future clashes 4) Constellation is too risky as a Conjury that could be cancelled, while Besiege is slower at P4. Gleam's pure advance effects don't provide the immediate pressure we need.
  Clash 3: YOU played Besiege
    Your strategy: Choosing Besiege is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At P4, it resolves before enemy PA spells, ensuring damage connects 2) The enemy has 3 HP and only 1 trunk - forcing a trunk loss here would be devastating 3) The advance effects will carry forward to the final clash, potentially setting up lethal 4) Both other options (Gleam and Constellation) are too slow at PA and P5 respectively, and Constellation being a Conjury makes it vulnerable to disruption. With enemy at critical health, we need guaranteed damage.
  Clash 4: YOU played Constellation
    Your strategy: Playing Constellation here is the optimal choice. With both Starfall and Besiege already active from previous clashes, and the opponent at 3/4 HP with their last trunk, we can set up a devastating finish. Constellation's advance effects will carry forward into next round, potentially combining with our active spells to create a lethal combination. The opponent's Eventide and Coalesce indicate they're likely setting up for defense, but our established board presence gives us the advantage.

  "analysis": "This was a masterclass in pressure and positioning that effectively cornered the opponent into their last trunk. Let's analyze the key strategic elements:

  STRONG POINTS:
  1. Progressive Pressure Sequencing
  - Opening with Turbulence (P4) into Starfall (P3) created immediate pressure
  - Each clash built additional threatening layers without overcommitting
  - The spell priority sequence prevented easy counterplay
  
  2. Resource Management
  - Maintained card advantage (2 cards vs 1) while applying constant pressure
  - Avoided playing vulnerable Conjuries until the final clash when risk was lowest
  - Preserved health at 4/6 while pushing opponent to critical position

  3. Technical Execution
  - Correctly identified Turbulence's 4-damage potential as key to trunk removal
  - Used advancing spells (Starfall, Besiege) to create compound threats
  - Built board presence that demands specific answers

  OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
  1. Defensive Positioning
  - Relying heavily on Wood/Twilight suggests a defensive strategy
  - Eventide + Coalesce shows desperation for protection
  - Seed + Grow indicate trying to build resources rather than address immediate threats

  2. Resource Management
  - Down to last card, limiting reactive options
  - Failed to maintain trunk parity early, now in survival position
  
  KEY LEARNING:
  The opponent's focus on defensive scaling (Wood/Twilight combination) proved ineffective against our layered pressure strategy. In similar positions, they should consider:
  - More proactive threat management
  - Earlier trunk preservation plays
  - Maintaining card parity for reactive options

  This round demonstrates how effective pressure sequencing can force opponents into increasingly difficult defensive positions while maintaining strategic flexibility."

=== ROUND 13 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/6 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/4 HP, 1 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Illuminate
    Your strategy: Selecting Illuminate (P1) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) At P1, it's the fastest spell available, guaranteeing it resolves first 2) The opponent is down to their last trunk - any significant damage could end the game 3) Illuminate offers powerful complex effects that can be game-changing 4) Holding Reflect (P4) and Glare (P5) gives flexibility for later clashes, especially if the opponent tries to set up defensive plays 5) The conjury nature of Glare makes it risky against potential cancellation
  Clash 2: YOU played Glare
    Your strategy: Glare is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The enemy is at 4/4 HP, so the weaken effect will permanently reduce their max HP while the damage puts immediate pressure 2) With Illuminate active, my Sunbeam spells gain extra effects 3) While it's a Conjury that could be cancelled, the enemy would need specific cards to do so, and the risk is worth taking given their vulnerable position with 1 trunk 4) Encumber and Blow are less impactful here - we want to maintain offensive pressure to close out the game against a single-trunk opponent
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: This is a critical position with the enemy at 3/4 HP and 1 trunk. They have Clap active which could threaten damage, but I already have strong offensive pressure with Illuminate, Reflect, and Glare active. Encumber (P2) is the superior choice here because:

1. Its P2 priority lets it resolve before most responses and attacks
2. It can advance to help set up future clashes
3. Its response/boost effects can help protect my active spell chain

Blowing would be less effective since I already have strong offensive presence and don't need the advance priority effect as much as the defensive utility of Encumber.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Illuminate (Sunbeam)
  - YOUR Reflect (Sunbeam)
  - YOUR Glare (Sunbeam)
  - YOUR Encumber (Venom)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Clap (Thunder)
  - THEIR Gravitate (Space)

==================================================

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful execution of a complex Sunbeam chain strategy that has put us in an extremely advantageous position:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Opening with Illuminate (P1) was crucial - it established the foundation for our Sunbeam synergy while avoiding any potential disruption
2. Following up with Glare demonstrated perfect timing - the opponent's defenses were minimal and the weaken effect permanently reduced their max HP
3. The Encumber play in Clash 3 showed advanced foresight - it protected our spell chain while setting up future pressure

Opponent's Critical Mistakes:
1. They failed to establish early defensive positioning, allowing our Illuminate to resolve uncontested
2. Their Clap placement was suboptimal - while it threatens damage, it came too late to disrupt our established Sunbeam chain
3. Gravitate shows they're trying to set up positional advantage, but at this stage they needed immediate defensive options

Current Position Analysis:
- We have a dominant board state with three Sunbeam spells creating synergy
- Our HP at 4/6 is healthy, while they're at 3/4 with reduced max HP
- Most critically, they're on their last trunk with limited cards in hand

Learning Opportunity for Opponent:
Against Sunbeam chains, early disruption is essential. They should have prioritized:
1. Early P1-P2 responses to contest Illuminate
2. Damage/weaken effects to threaten our Conjury spells
3. Trunk preservation through defensive positioning

This round demonstrates the power of properly sequenced element chains and the importance of preventing your opponent from establishing their preferred board state."

[SAVANT] Round 14 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 14 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/7 HP, 2 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  CHAMPION_AI: 3/4 HP, 1 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as SAVANT_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Renew
    Your strategy: In this critical endgame position with the enemy down to their last trunk, Renew is the optimal play for several reasons: 1) It both bolsters and heals, potentially putting me at 6/7 HP which creates a massive health advantage, 2) While it's a Conjury that could be cancelled, the enemy having only 1 trunk left means they're likely to play defensively rather than aggressively, 3) The Priority 5 timing means we'll see what they do first at higher priorities, and 4) Even if cancelled, it baits out potential removal that could threaten our other powerful Conjuries like Shrine or Dominion in later clashes.
  Clash 2: YOU played Slumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Slumber is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With enemy at 3/4 HP and one trunk, I need to protect my health lead rather than risk conjuries that could be cancelled. 2) Slumber provides immediate healing plus advance effects, helping maintain board presence. 3) Both Shrine and Dominion are P5 conjuries that could be cancelled, making them risky plays when I'm ahead. 4) The heal from Slumber combines well with my active Renew for sustained healing pressure.
  Clash 3: YOU played Dominion
    Your strategy: Playing Dominion here is a strong move for several reasons: 1) The enemy is at 3/4 HP with only 1 trunk left - landing Dominion could be game-ending, 2) I have Renew and Slumber active which means I'm well-protected and can afford to play a Conjury, 3) The enemy's Electrocute boost isn't particularly threatening to my Dominion since it doesn't deal direct damage, 4) Even if Dominion gets cancelled, I've forced the enemy to respond defensively rather than press their advantage, 5) P5 timing means it resolves after most responses would hit.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Renew (Ichor)
  - YOUR Slumber (Moonshine)
  - YOUR Dominion (Ichor)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Electrocute (Lightning)
  - THEIR Surge (Lightning)

==================================================

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of strategic positioning that showcases high-level Elemental Elephants play. Let's break it down:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Opening with Renew was tactically sound - it established a health buffer while forcing the opponent to choose between cancelling it (using valuable resources) or letting it resolve. The P5 timing was key, allowing us to see their plays first.

2. The Slumber follow-up was particularly elegant. Not only did it provide healing, but its advance effect meant sustained pressure. More importantly, it created a defensive wall that made it safer to play Dominion later.

3. The sequencing was perfect - starting with Renew (risky but high reward), then Slumber (safe, sustained value), and finally Dominion (potential game-ender) when we had protection in place.

OPPONENT'S PLAYS:
- Their Electrocute + Surge combination shows good understanding of spell synergy, but it wasn't enough against our layered strategy
- They may have been too conservative with their remaining cards, perhaps holding responses that could have disrupted our Conjuries

KEY LEARNING:
The most important lesson from this round is how to properly sequence Conjuries. By establishing Renew first and following with Slumber's protection, we created a safe environment for Dominion. This is advanced spell layering at its finest.

CRITICAL POSITION:
We're now at 5/7 HP with 2 trunks versus their 3/4 HP with 1 trunk. While they have 2 cards to our 0, our active spell advantage means we're heavily favored to close out the game.

This round demonstrates why Elemental Elephants is as much about resource management and spell sequencing as it is about individual card power."

[SAVANT] Round 1 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 3 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Opening with Coalesce (P1 Twilight boost) is a strong strategic choice for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before most other options, protecting it from disruption 2) Being a boost spell, it can set up powerful combinations for future clashes 3) The advance effect allows for extended value and board presence 4) Starting with Twilight alignment enables potential synergies with Crepuscule and Eventide later in the round 5) Holding Thunder spells (Clap, Break, Stupefy) maintains flexibility for counter-play
  Clash 2: YOU played Eventide
    Your strategy: Playing Eventide (P2 Twilight boost) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) We already have Coalesce active, and Eventide synergizes extremely well with other Twilight spells, setting up for powerful combinations. 2) The P2 priority gives us good positioning to respond to potential threats while still being fast enough to get value. 3) With enemy at 5/6 HP and Nightglow active, they likely have defensive plans - Eventide helps us build our board presence without committing too heavily. 4) Saving Daybreak (P1) and our Thunder options gives us flexibility for later clashes. 5) While Crepuscule is powerful, playing it now as a P5 Conjury makes it vulnerable to disruption.
  Clash 3: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Daybreak is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With Eventide, Crepuscule, and Coalesce already active, playing Daybreak completes an extremely powerful Twilight engine. 2) As a P1 spell, it will resolve before the enemy can respond, and Twilight spells often have strong synergies when multiple are in play. 3) The enemy has Nightglow active which suggests they're setting up a defensive/healing strategy - Daybreak's complex effects could help break through that. 4) Having Thunder spells in hand gives flexibility for next clash if needed, but the Twilight synergy is too valuable to pass up here.
  Clash 4: YOU played Clap
    Your strategy: Clap is the optimal play here for multiple reasons: 1) It has Advance effects which will carry forward momentum into the next round, critical since we already have strong Twilight synergy built up with Crepuscule/Daybreak/Coalesce. 2) As a P2 Thunder response/boost, it matches priority with their Bedim while giving us turn order advantage. 3) Most importantly, it avoids committing Stupefy or Eventide which could be more valuable next round for building on our Twilight engine.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Crepuscule (Twilight)
  - YOUR Daybreak (Twilight)
  - YOUR Coalesce (Twilight)
  - YOUR Clap (Thunder)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Slumber (Moonshine)

==================================================

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "Let me analyze this round as a grandmaster:

  STRONG POINTS IN OUR PLAY:
  - Excellent Twilight engine construction starting with P1 Coalesce
  - Successfully baited out their Bedim cancel with Crepuscule while maintaining board presence
  - Strong card advantage through Eventide's recall effect
  - Brilliant theft of their Nightglow into our discard pile for potential future use
  - Maintained pressure while building a powerful spell ecosystem

  OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
  1. Opening with Nightglow bolster was defensive but telegraphed their strategy
  2. Using Bedim to cancel Crepuscule was suboptimal - they fell for our bait
  3. Slumber's healing was inefficient since they were already at max health
  4. Poor hand management - down to 2 cards while we have 3

  KEY STRATEGIC VICTORY:
  We effectively controlled the pace of the game by:
  - Forcing reactive plays from opponent
  - Building a strong Twilight presence that persists into next round
  - Maintaining card advantage
  - Stealing their Nightglow for potential future use
  - Having Clap advance into next round for continued pressure

  INNOVATIVE ELEMENT:
  The Crepuscule bait into Daybreak sequence was particularly elegant. By making them waste Bedim on Crepuscule, we protected our more important Daybreak play while still maintaining board presence.

  LOOKING AHEAD:
  We're in an excellent position with:
  - Strong active spell presence
  - Card advantage
  - Their Nightglow in our discard (denying them access while giving us options)
  - Clap advancing to next round
  
  The opponent needs to find answers to our Twilight engine quickly or risk falling further behind in board presence and card advantage."

=== ROUND 1 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 3 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Opening with Accelerator (P1 Conjury) is a strong play for several reasons: 1) As a P1 spell, it resolves before anything the opponent can play, 2) While it's vulnerable to being cancelled as a Conjury, the Time element suggests potential advance/priority manipulation which could set up powerful sequences, 3) Having multiple Time cards (Accelerator, Repeater) hints at synergistic advance effects we can chain together, 4) Starting with a setup piece is safer than committing to early damage since we don't know opponent's defensive capabilities.
  Clash 2: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Selecting Encumber (P2) for several strategic reasons: 1) With Accelerator active, I want to leverage fast priority spells to maintain tempo advantage. Encumber at P2 is perfect for this. 2) Enemy has Root active which suggests they may be setting up for bigger plays - Encumber's advance effects can disrupt their setup. 3) Having both Accelerator and Encumber advancing creates powerful ongoing pressure. 4) Saving Quickshot and damage spells for when I can maximize their impact, rather than potentially hitting into defensive plays.
  Clash 3: YOU played Quickshot
    Your strategy: Selecting Quickshot (P3 Time attack) is optimal here for several reasons:
1. With Accelerator active, we want to capitalize on Time synergy
2. As a P3 spell, it will resolve before most defensive options
3. Being a Conjury makes it vulnerable, but the enemy's Break boost suggests they're setting up for later rather than immediate threats
4. 2 damage is significant early pressure
5. Saving Repeater for next clash gives us better positioning for final clash setup
6. Both Venom options are less impactful without confirmed defensive plays to respond to
  Clash 4: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Enfeeble is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With Encumber and Accelerator active, enemy Break will be less effective 2) The P4 priority ensures it resolves after most responses but before advances 3) The 1 damage helps set up pressure while maintaining card advantage 4) Most importantly, its advance effects will carry forward, potentially disrupting enemy setup next round

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "Let's break down this fascinating round from a grandmaster perspective:

KEY STRENGTHS OF OUR STRATEGY:
1. Spell Protection Chain
- Masterfully established an unbreakable chain of Accelerator advances
- This created a protective barrier making our spells immune to disruption
- Critical foundation that enabled our subsequent aggressive plays

2. Tempo Control
- Leveraged priority advantage effectively with P1-P3 plays
- Prevented opponent's advance attempts with well-timed Encumber
- Maintained initiative throughout the round

3. Resource Efficiency
- Preserved high health (5/5) while applying pressure
- Established board presence with advancing threats
- Ended with 2 cards in hand for next round

OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
1. Defensive Positioning
- Their Root + Break setup was too slow against our tempo
- Break advancing to clash 3 showed intention for late-game scaling
- However, our Encumber disrupted this strategy effectively

2. Resource Investment
- Absorb in clash 4 suggests defensive concerns
- But with our protection chain, defensive plays became less impactful
- Could have been more aggressive early to contest our setup

CRITICAL TURNING POINT:
The key moment was clash 2 where our Encumber prevented their advance strategy while simultaneously advancing our own threats. This created an insurmountable tempo advantage.

STRATEGIC INNOVATIONS:
The Time + Venom combination proved extremely effective:
- Time elements provided priority advantage
- Venom elements disrupted opponent's setup
- Together they created a 'lock' that was hard to break

Looking ahead to round 2, we should expect:
1. More aggressive plays from opponent to break our momentum
2. Possible Thunder counter-strategy to their Break setup
3. Need to capitalize on our established board position

A technically precise round that demonstrated the power of priority manipulation and advance control."

[SAVANT] Round 2 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 2 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 5/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Playing Accelerator (Time Conjury) at P1 is optimal here for several reasons: 1) It's our fastest option and will resolve before any potential threats, 2) As a Conjury it can bait out damage/weaken effects that might otherwise hit us directly, 3) Its advance effects can set up powerful combinations in future clashes. While Encumber at P2 is tempting for control, establishing Time magic dominance early is crucial. The enemy's higher health (6/6) suggests they may be setting up for a big play, so getting our engine running first is key.
  Clash 2: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Playing Agonize (P3) is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Accelerator active, we want to maintain offensive pressure while the enemy has Root which suggests defensive positioning. 2) Agonize's advance effects combined with Accelerator can create powerful follow-up pressure. 3) Encumber at P2 is too early without knowing enemy's play, while Repeater as a Conjury is risky against unknown responses. The guaranteed 1 damage from Agonize helps push towards trunk loss while setting up future advantage.
  Clash 3: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: Playing Encumber (P2) is the optimal choice here. With Agonize already active and Clap threatening response damage, Encumber's early priority can help control the clash. The Repeater conjury would be vulnerable to cancellation and resolves too late as PA. Additionally, Encumber's advance effects synergize with our active Accelerator, setting up stronger position control for the final clash.
  Clash 4: YOU played Repeater
    Your strategy: Playing Repeater here is a strong setup move. With Accelerator already active, I have momentum in the Time element. While Repeater is a conjury and thus vulnerable, it's the last clash of the round so there's minimal risk. The enemy has Thunder-focused spells active (Clap and Break) but no immediate way to capitalize on my conjury. This positions me well for next round's opening clash where advance effects will be crucial.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of positioning and spell protection. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

STRENGTHS OF OUR PLAY:
1. Opening with Accelerator was crucial - it established spell protection that carried throughout the round, preventing any Thunder disruption from affecting our gameplan
2. The Agonize + Accelerator combination created consistent pressure while being protected
3. Our spell sequencing maintained perfect protection while building a strong board presence

OPPONENT'S CHALLENGES:
1. Their Thunder-heavy hand (Clap, Break, Stupefy) struggled against our protected spells
2. Root's defensive positioning wasn't enough without ways to disrupt our engine
3. They failed to establish meaningful counter-pressure, letting us build freely

KEY TURNING POINT:
The most decisive moment was Clash 1, where our Accelerator nullified their entire Thunder-based disruption strategy. This single play essentially invalidated much of their hand's potential.

INNOVATIVE ELEMENT:
Our use of Encumber in Clash 3 was particularly elegant - it provided additional advance control while being protected by Accelerator, creating a "protected advance chain" that's difficult to disrupt.

BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:
We've established an incredibly strong position:
- Multiple protected advancing spells
- Repeater ready to generate value next round
- Health advantage (5/5 vs 6/6)
- Complete spell protection chain

The opponent will need significant element diversity in their next draft to break through our protected spell chain. Their Thunder-focused strategy proved too narrow against our protection-based approach.

This round demonstrates the importance of element diversity and protection mechanics in high-level play. While Thunder is powerful for disruption, having answers to protection effects is crucial."

[SAVANT] Round 3 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 3 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 2/5 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 3/6 HP, 3 trunks, 0 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Quickshot
    Your strategy: Selecting Quickshot (Time attack) for several strategic reasons: 1) At P3, it threatens immediate damage while the opponent is at full health 6/6, 2) Being a Conjury makes it slightly risky, but worth it given the potential tempo advantage, 3) The other options are mostly defensive/healing which aren't needed since we're at full health 5/5, 4) A successful 2 damage hit would put meaningful pressure and force defensive plays from the opponent
  Clash 2: YOU played Cleanse
    Your strategy: Cleanse is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) We're at full health so pure healing from Nourish or Flow isn't needed, 2) Cleanse's attack component gives us another source of pressure while the healing provides flexibility if needed, 3) At Priority 3, it resolves before their active Crush spell which is PA priority, giving us initiative, 4) Having multiple sources of damage between Quickshot and Cleanse increases our chance of breaking through any defensive plays.
  Clash 3: YOU played Flow
    Your strategy: Flow is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) The P3 priority allows it to heal before taking damage from the enemy's Earth spells, 2) It advances to provide ongoing value, 3) With Cleanse already active, we're building strong Water synergy which enhances our defensive position. The heal ensures we stay at max HP going into potential heavy damage, while the advance effect sets up future healing potential.

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Quickshot (Time)
  - YOUR Cleanse (Water)
  - YOUR Flow (Water)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Crush (Earth)
  - THEIR Quake (Earth)

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful round by my opponent, demonstrating superior Earth element control and spell sequencing. Let's break down the key strategic elements:

OPPONENT'S WINNING SEQUENCE:
1. Used Crush (PA) perfectly to counter my Quickshot Conjury
2. Set up Quake + Aftershocks combo for guaranteed damage
3. Added Punishment as a finisher to maximize damage output
4. Maintained card advantage while forcing my discards

MY STRATEGIC MISTAKES:
1. Opening with Quickshot was too risky - as a Conjury against Earth, it was vulnerable to cancellation
2. Cleanse + Flow combination, while solid defensively, didn't provide enough offensive pressure
3. Failed to anticipate the full Earth combo potential

DAMAGE MATHEMATICS:
- I dealt 3 total damage (2 from Quickshot before cancel, 1 from Cleanse)
- They dealt 3 damage while maintaining card advantage and position
- The health differential (2/5 vs 3/6) favors them significantly

KEY LEARNING:
The opponent demonstrated excellent element mastery by:
1. Using Earth's natural Conjury-hate to neutralize Quickshot
2. Chaining PA priority spells to guarantee damage
3. Converting card advantage into health advantage

For future matches against Earth-heavy decks:
- Save Conjuries until opponent's cancel effects are exhausted
- Consider more aggressive Priority 1-2 plays to race their setup

[SAVANT] Round 4 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 4 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Gravitate
    Your strategy: Selecting Gravitate at P1 is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At 2/5 HP, I need to control the clash and prevent incoming damage - P1 gives me first action. 2) Being a Space spell, it has powerful positioning effects that can disrupt enemy plans. 3) Holding the P5 Conjuries (Wormhole/Impact) would be risky as they're vulnerable to cancellation when we're both low HP and likely to play aggressively. 4) Enfeeble at P4 is too slow given the critical health situation.
  Clash 2: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Choosing Enfeeble (P4) is the optimal play here. With the enemy at 3 HP and active Familiar, we need reliable damage that can't be easily disrupted. While Wormhole and Impact are powerful Conjuries, they're vulnerable to being cancelled and are slower at P5. Enfeeble provides guaranteed P4 damage that resolves before most responses, and its advance effects could be valuable in the upcoming clashes. The 1 damage brings the enemy to 2 HP, setting up potential lethal scenarios.
  Clash 3: YOU played Impact
    Your strategy: Impact is the superior choice here for several reasons: 1) Both spells are P5 Conjuries, but Impact's attack potential is critical given our low HP situation and the presence of enemy Shadow spells 2) With Enfeeble active, we can potentially weaken their defenses while setting up damage 3) Impact can potentially clear enemy spells while also threatening damage 4) Wormhole's complex effects, while powerful, are riskier given our vulnerable position - we need more direct threats

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Gravitate (Space)
  - YOUR Enfeeble (Venom)

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was an expertly executed round that demonstrated high-level strategic play and resource management. Let's break down the key decisions:

1. Opening with Gravitate (P1):
- Perfect priority selection given our vulnerable 2 HP position
- Established board control early and protected against potential aggression
- Demonstrated understanding of priority-based defense

2. Mid-round Enfeeble (P4):
- Calculated damage sequencing with guaranteed resolution
- Smart advance mechanic usage for sustained pressure
- Avoided the trap of playing vulnerable P5 Conjuries too early

3. Closing Impact (P5):
- Masterful finishing move that leveraged multiple spell synergies
- The 2-damage burst from hitting multiple spells was devastating
- Showed excellent timing by waiting until opponent committed resources

Key Victory Factors:
- Priority manipulation across all clashes
- Damage sequencing that forced awkward responses
- Understanding when to deploy Conjuries safely

The opponent made several strategic errors:
1. Overcommitting spells against Impact's multi-target potential
2. Not adequately protecting against Space element threats
3. Poor trunk preservation at critical health thresholds

This victory showcases the importance of:
- Resource management under pressure
- Understanding element interactions
- Proper spacing of priority levels across clashes

A particularly elegant aspect was using Enfeeble's advance effect to maintain pressure while setting up the Impact finisher. This is grandmaster-level spell sequencing that newer players should study."

[SAVANT] Round 5 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 5 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 1/5 HP, 3 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Critical defensive position requires immediate action. Coalesce at P1 is the safest play since I'm at 1 HP and can't risk slower spells. Its advance effects can help set up future clashes while providing immediate protection. Crepuscule is too risky as a Conjury at P5 - I could lose it to damage before it resolves. Eventide at P2 doesn't provide enough immediate protection.
  Clash 2: YOU played Eventide
    Your strategy: Critical defensive positioning needed. At 1 HP, I must protect against lethal damage. Eventide (P2) is the fastest non-P1 option and has protective qualities. With Coalesce active, Eventide gains additional utility. Crepuscule is too slow at P5 and risky as a Conjury. While Daybreak is fastest, its effects are less impactful in this situation where survival is paramount.
  Clash 3: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Critical defensive situation at 1 HP requires immediate action. Daybreak (P1) is the optimal choice because:
1) We must prevent lethal damage this clash - P1 gives us the fastest possible response
2) With Coalesce + Eventide active, our Twilight spells are empowered
3) Crepuscule at P5 would be too slow and risky at 1 HP
4) Enemy Break suggests they may have Thunder damage coming - we need to act before potential lethal damage
  Clash 4: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Critical defensive play here with Coalesce. At P1, it resolves before any potential damage from Stupefy, and being at 1 HP means survival is paramount. Coalesce's advance effects can potentially carry forward value, while Crepuscule being a P5 Conjury is too slow and risky when we're this low on health.

==================================================

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This was a masterful defensive round that showcased the power of Twilight spell synergies and priority manipulation. Let's break it down:

KEY STRATEGIC ELEMENTS:
1. Survival Chain: Operating at 1 HP, we executed a perfect defensive chain using P1-P2 priority spells:
   - Coalesce → Eventide → Daybreak → Coalesce
   - Each spell protected and enhanced the others
   - The priority sequencing ensured no damage could get through

2. Spell Protection Network:
   - Multiple layers of Coalesce's protection effects prevented any disruption
   - This nullified potential Thunder control effects from Break/Stupefy
   - Created an impenetrable defensive position

3. Advance Control:
   - We successfully restricted enemy advance mechanics
   - This prevented them from setting up potentially lethal combinations
   - Particularly important against Thunder's burst damage potential

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Over-commitment to Thunder setup without securing lethal damage
2. Failed to account for Twilight's protective capabilities
3. Could have held resources for a concentrated burst attempt

INNOVATIVE ASPECTS:
The most impressive element was the 'rolling fortress' created by advancing Coalesce while layering additional Twilight protections. This demonstrated how defensive play can be both reactive AND proactive.

LEARNING POINTS:
- Twilight's defensive capabilities extend beyond simple protection
- Priority sequencing is crucial when operating at low HP
- Sometimes the best offense is an impenetrable defense

This round showcases why Twilight is considered one of the most technically demanding elements to play against when properly executed."

[SAVANT] Round 6 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 6 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 0 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Accelerator
    Your strategy: Critical situation requires precise timing. At 1 HP, I must prevent lethal damage. Accelerator as P1 Conjury gives maximum control over priority and timing. While vulnerable to cancellation, it enables powerful advance effects that can protect me and set up future plays. Crepuscule is too slow at P5, Agonize's damage is minimal, and Encumber's response may not trigger. The tempo advantage from Accelerator is essential for surviving this round.
  Clash 2: YOU played Encumber
    Your strategy: At 1 HP and facing an opponent with 6 HP, I need to be extremely careful. While Crepuscule has powerful effects, being a Conjury makes it vulnerable to cancellation. More importantly, I'm in a critical position where I can't risk a P5 spell - I need faster responses. Encumber at P2 is much safer and provides advance effects that can help set up future clashes. The Accelerator already active also suggests building momentum rather than risking a slow Conjury that could be cancelled before providing value.
  Clash 3: YOU played Crepuscule
    Your strategy: Playing Crepuscule here is a strong move despite its P5 speed. With only 1 HP, we need its healing potential, and the Conjury aspect is less risky since the enemy's active spells don't show direct damage capabilities. Our Accelerator will help speed up future spells, and Encumber can potentially disrupt enemy plays. The complex effects of Crepuscule could give us options to stabilize our position while at critical health.

OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Quake (Earth)
  - THEIR Clap (Thunder)
  - THEIR Crush (Earth)
  - THEIR Aftershocks (Earth)

KEY BATTLE EVENTS:
  - CHAMPION_AI discarded [Agonize].
  - ➡️ CHAMPION_AI's [Accelerator] advanced from Clash 1 to Clash 2.
  - ➡️ CHAMPION_AI's [Encumber] advanced from Clash 2 to Clash 3.

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "This round demonstrated my opponent's masterful understanding of spell sequencing and priority manipulation. Let me break down the key elements:

OPPONENT'S WINNING STRATEGY:
1. Earth-heavy composition showed clear intent - they drafted for consistent weaken effects
2. Brilliant use of Crush to both cancel my Crepuscule AND apply weaken
3. Clap's repeated advances maintained pressure while enabling their combo
4. Perfect timing with Aftershocks for the finishing damage

MY CRITICAL MISTAKES:
1. Over-reliance on Crepuscule at P5 when opponent showed Earth spells
- Should have anticipated the weaken-cancel threat
- Playing a Conjury while low HP against Earth was too risky

2. Accelerator + Encumber sequence was solid but insufficient
- Good priority control attempt
- However, didn't provide enough protection against their multi-spell assault

LEARNING POINTS:
1. Against Earth-heavy opponents, must respect weaken threats
2. Conjuries need better protection when at critical HP
3. Advance effects alone don't provide enough defense without direct counterplay

The opponent executed a textbook Earth control strategy:
- Used Crush's advance to maintain weaken pressure
- Leveraged Thunder (Clap) for additional advance threats
- Closed with guaranteed damage via Aftershocks

This was a masterclass in element synergy and priority manipulation. While my Accelerator-Encumber sequence showed good understanding of priority control, the opponent's superior spell composition and execution deserved the win. Their ability to maintain multiple threats while advancing key spells demonstrated high-level mastery."

[SAVANT] Round 7 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 7 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Repeater
    Your strategy: Playing Repeater (Time boost) is a strong opening move here. As a Conjury that advances, it can set up powerful combinations in future clashes while forcing the opponent to make difficult decisions. If they ignore it, it provides ongoing value. If they try to cancel it with damage, that's damage not going to my face. At 4/4 HP vs their 6/6, I need to create pressure and card advantage rather than just trading blows. The advance effect also means it continues providing value even if cancelled this clash.
  Clash 2: YOU played Seed
    Your strategy: Playing Seed is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With Repeater active, we want to maximize advance effects to get multiple activations 2) Punishment is a response spell that could punish us for playing attacks or remedies, making Seed the safest option 3) The enemy is at 6/6 HP while we're at 4/4 HP - we need to set up a strong position rather than make risky plays 4) Seed's advance effects will give us more options and flexibility in upcoming clashes
  Clash 3: YOU played Nourish
    Your strategy: Nourish is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) At 2 HP, I'm extremely vulnerable and need healing to avoid trunk loss 2) P3 priority means it resolves before most attacks 3) With Repeater and Seed active, I have offensive potential already set up, so defensive play is warranted 4) Enemy has Punishment and Enfeeble active, suggesting they're setting up for a big attack - surviving that setup is crucial 5) Going to 4 HP gives me much better positioning for the final clash
  Clash 4: YOU played Grow
    Your strategy: Choosing Grow (P3) is optimal here for multiple reasons: 1) It resolves before the enemy's response spells, letting me heal/bolster before they can trigger 2) With Nourish already active, Grow's healing will be amplified 3) I need to maintain health going into next round since enemy has multiple threatening response spells active 4) Prickle would resolve too late (P4) and likely trigger multiple negative responses

YOUR ACTIVE SPELLS (spells YOU played):
  - YOUR Repeater (Time)
  - YOUR Nourish (Water)
  - YOUR Grow (Wood)
OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):
  - THEIR Sap (Shadow)
  - THEIR Punishment (Nectar)
  - THEIR Enfeeble (Venom)
  - THEIR Familiar (Shadow)

KEY BATTLE EVENTS:
  - SAVANT_AI's [Punishment] CANCELLED [Repeater] (1 damage used).

==================================================

[SAVANT] API Response:
{
  "analysis": "Let me analyze this round from a grandmaster perspective:

  STRONG POINTS IN MY PLAY:
  - Opening with Repeater was tactically sound - it forced the opponent to use Punishment's damage to cancel it, preventing that damage from hitting face
  - The Nourish timing in Clash 3 was critical, perfectly countering the opponent's damage setup and maintaining healthy position
  - Managed resources efficiently, using each card to maximum effect despite having fewer cards than opponent

  OPPONENT'S STRONG MOVES:
  - Excellent use of Punishment as a flexible control tool - both cancelling Repeater and dealing face damage
  - Strong spell chain with Enfeeble + Punishment creating consistent pressure
  - Good advancement sequencing keeping their threats active across multiple clashes

  KEY STRATEGIC PATTERNS:
  1. Priority Management: Used P3 spells (Nourish, Grow) to resolve before opponent's responses
  2. Health Management: Recovered from 2 HP back to full through careful healing timing
  3. Resource Efficiency: Made every card count while opponent had card advantage

  LEARNING POINTS:
  - Opponent's Shadow/Nectar/Venom combination shows strong element synergy - worth studying this archetype
  - The Familiar + Punishment + Enfeeble chain creates difficult decision points for the opponent
  
  LOOKING AHEAD:
  - Both players at 2 trunks makes next round critically important
  - Opponent has more cards (2 vs 1) going into next round
  - Active spells favor opponent with Punishment, Enfeeble, and Familiar still threatening

  Overall, while I maintained health and avoided trunk loss, opponent has established better board position with multiple active threats and card advantage. Next round will require careful resource management."

[SAVANT] Round 8 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 8 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 6/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Gravitate
    Your strategy: Selecting Gravitate (P1) for several strategic reasons: 1) It's our highest priority spell which gives us initiative and control over the clash. 2) At equal health/trunks, having a P1 spell provides significant advantage in dictating the flow. 3) Complex effects at P1 are typically game-changing. 4) We're holding defensive options like Flow and Cleanse that can respond to aftermath. 5) Against a skilled opponent at high stakes (2 trunks each), controlling the priority sequence is crucial.
  Clash 2: YOU played Quickshot
    Your strategy: Playing Quickshot (P3 Time attack) is optimal here for several reasons:

1. With enemy at 6/6 HP and Root active, they likely want to set up a defensive position. Quickshot applies immediate pressure.

2. While Quickshot is a Conjury and vulnerable to cancellation, the enemy's Root is a boost spell and unlikely to have cancel effects.

3. Priority 3 is fast enough to resolve before their likely defensive plays (P4-P5).

4. We already have Gravitate active which could help protect or combo with Quickshot.

5. Saving Cleanse and Flow for later could be valuable for recovery if needed.
  Clash 3: YOU played Flow
    Your strategy: Flow is the optimal choice here for multiple reasons: 1) At 3/4 HP, healing to full gives better survival odds 2) Flow's P3 priority matches enemy Quickshot, and since I'm Ringleader I'll resolve first 3) Most importantly, Flow's advance effect will be valuable next clash since enemy has Root active which suggests they're setting up for a big play 4) Prickle at P4 would be too slow and Cleanse's attack would be less valuable than Flow's defensive utility given the board state.
  Clash 4: YOU played Cleanse
    Your strategy: Selecting Cleanse (P3) is the optimal play here. With both players at 2 trunks, and the opponent at full health while I'm at 3/4, damage mitigation and healing are critical. Cleanse will resolve before the opponent's Stupefy and Quickshot due to its P3 priority, potentially allowing me to heal before taking damage. Additionally, if their Stupefy or Quickshot would deal damage this clash, Cleanse's response effect could provide additional value. Prickle's P4 would resolve too late to prevent incoming damage.

  "analysis": "Let me break this down from a grandmaster's perspective:

Key Strategic Elements:
1. Opening with Gravitate (P1) was technically sound for spell protection, but we failed to capitalize on its advantage. The opponent's Imitate demonstrated superior foresight, copying our protection effect.

2. Our Quickshot play in Clash 2 was a critical mistake. Against a Time specialist, we should have anticipated the opposing Quickshot. This resulted in a 1-for-1 Conjury trade where we lost priority due to their Ringleader status.

3. The opponent's Root advancement shows masterful setup work. They're clearly building towards a powerful combination while maintaining board control.

Opponent's Strengths:
- Excellent priority manipulation with Imitate
- Strong defensive positioning with Root
- Efficient resource management (2 cards vs our 1)

Our Shortcomings:
- Predictable Quickshot timing
- Suboptimal Flow usage that didn't maximize healing potential
- Failed to prevent their spell advancement strategy

Learning Points:
1. Against equal-skill opponents, telegraphed Conjury plays will be punished
2. Root advancement suggests incoming combo - we need to prepare defensive options
3. Card advantage (2:1) puts us at a significant disadvantage for the next round

The opponent demonstrated superior strategic depth this round. Their Imitate into Root sequence shows tournament-level planning that we must respect and adapt to.

*adjusts championship medal thoughtfully*

For future rounds, we need to be more conservative with Conjury spells and focus on disrupting their obvious setup plays. Their card advantage means we're fighting from behind - we'll need to make every spell count."

[SAVANT] Round 9 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 9 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 2 trunks, 1 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 3/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Eventide
    Your strategy: Selecting Eventide (P2 Twilight boost) as a high-priority play. At this critical stage with both players at 2 trunks, having a P2 spell gives me initiative advantage and can disrupt potential enemy setups. Eventide's effects could provide crucial board control. I'm avoiding the P5 Conjuries (Impact, Wormhole) as they're too slow and vulnerable to cancellation. While Prickle and Enfeeble are solid P4 options, they don't give me the tempo advantage I need in this opening clash.
  Clash 2: YOU played Prickle
    Your strategy: Selecting Prickle is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) It's a P4 spell which gives us good timing, 2) We're facing a SAVANT with 6 HP and need reliable damage output, 3) Conjury spells (Impact/Wormhole) are too risky as they can be easily cancelled, 4) Enfeeble could be good but Prickle likely has better synergy with our active Eventide boost spell. Also, Prickle being Wood element diversifies our elemental approach which makes our plays harder to counter.
  Clash 3: YOU played Enfeeble
    Your strategy: Selecting Enfeeble is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) It's the safest priority at P4, while both Space options are risky P5 Conjuries that could be cancelled. 2) With Break active, we need to be cautious about Conjuries as Thunder often has cancel effects. 3) Enfeeble's advance effects give us strategic flexibility for the final clash. 4) The 1 damage helps pressure their health lead while avoiding over-committing resources.
  Clash 4: YOU played Impact
    Your strategy: Impact is the stronger choice here. With Eventide active, my Impact will deal bonus damage. The enemy has Break and Clap active which could be threatening, but Impact's high damage potential makes it worth the risk. While both Impact and Wormhole are P5 Conjuries, Impact provides immediate value while Wormhole's utility is more situational. Additionally, being the final clash of the round means we don't need to worry about setting up future plays.

[SAVANT] API Response:

  "analysis": "This was a masterful round of play that demonstrated superior strategic control and damage sequencing. Let's break down the key elements:

STRATEGIC VICTORIES:
1. Eventide Opening (P2) - This was crucial for maintaining board control and enhancing our Impact damage later. The P2 priority gave us excellent tempo.

2. Damage Sequencing:
- Prickle (1 damage) → Enfeeble (1 damage) → Impact (1 damage)
- Perfect steady pressure that brought opponent from 6 HP down to 3 HP

3. Priority Management:
- Used P2 → P4 → P4 → P5 progression
- Avoided playing Conjuries early when they were most vulnerable
- Saved Impact for last clash when opponent had fewer options to counter

OPPONENT'S MISTAKES:
1. Break + Clap Combination:
- While Break is normally strong, they failed to capitalize on its advance potential
- The Thunder-heavy strategy left them without sufficient defensive options

2. Resource Management:
- Ending with 2 cards while we have 1 suggests suboptimal card usage
- Failed to prevent our consistent damage output each clash

INNOVATIVE ASPECTS:
- Using Eventide's boost effect to enhance our final Impact damage
- Maintaining perfect spacing between damage spells to apply constant pressure
- Clever use of Enfeeble's advance potential while avoiding opponent's Break advances

LOOKING AHEAD:
We've established a strong position with:
- Health advantage (4/4 vs 3/6)
- Similar trunk count (2 each)
- Comparable hand size (1 vs 2)

The key to victory will be maintaining this pressure while being mindful of potential Thunder-based counterplay in the next round."

[SAVANT] Round 10 Analysis Prompt:
=== ROUND 10 COMPLETE ===

YOUR STATUS: 4/4 HP, 1 trunks, 2 cards in hand
OPPONENT STATUS:
  SAVANT_AI: 2/6 HP, 2 trunks, 2 cards

YOUR PLAYS THIS ROUND (as CHAMPION_AI):
  Clash 1: YOU played Coalesce
    Your strategy: Playing Coalesce at P1 is optimal here for several reasons: 1) With both players at 2 trunks, we're in a critical phase where every HP matters. 2) Coalesce's P1 priority means it will resolve before most responses/counters. 3) The advance effects will provide ongoing value. 4) Our other options are riskier - Wormhole is too slow at P5, Accelerator as a Conjury is vulnerable to cancellation, and Agonize's 1 damage isn't impactful enough given the enemy's remaining HP.
  Clash 2: YOU played Daybreak
    Your strategy: Daybreak is the optimal play here for several reasons: 1) With P1 priority, it will resolve before most responses. 2) Given the enemy's Overexert is active, they may be setting up for a big play - Daybreak's P1 gives us initiative. 3) Twilight synergy with our active Coalesce creates powerful possibilities. 4) Holding Wormhole and Accelerator gives us strong late-clash options if needed. 5) Enemy is at 3/6 HP - putting pressure now while they're weakened is strategically sound.
  Clash 3: YOU played Agonize
    Your strategy: Choosing Agonize (P3) is the optimal play here for several reasons:

1. The enemy has Ritual active which is likely setting up for a powerful Blood finisher. Agonize's 1 damage threatens to drop them to 2 HP, putting them in a very dangerous position.

2. Accelerator (P1) is too risky as a Conjury that could be easily cancelled, and Wormhole (P5) is too slow for this critical moment.

3. Agonize's advance effects could be valuable going into the final clash, especially since we already have Daybreak and Coalesce active from Twilight.

4. With both players at 2 trunks, maintaining pressure while having advance potential gives us the most strategic flexibility.

OPPONENT'S ACTIVE SPELLS (spells THEY played):

  - THEIR Aftershocks (Earth)

KEY BATTLE EVENTS:

[SAVANT] API Response:

  "analysis": "This was a fascinating round with several key strategic moments worth analyzing:

STRONG POINTS:
1. Our Coalesce + Daybreak combination was extremely effective, setting up a strong Twilight engine while maintaining board presence. The P1 priority on both spells ensured they resolved cleanly.

2. The Daybreak discarding opponent's Overexert was a critical play - removing their setup piece disrupted potential future combinations.

OPPONENT'S COUNTERPLAY:
1. Their Ritual play was quite clever - they accepted taking 1 damage to themselves to weaken us by 2, dropping our max health to 2. This is a strong trade given we're down to our last trunk.

2. Their Aftershocks positioning shows good defensive awareness, protecting against potential aggressive plays.

KEY LESSONS:
1. The opponent's willingness to take calculated damage to achieve a strategic advantage (Ritual self-damage for weaken) demonstrates high-level thinking. This is something we should consider in future matches.

2. Our sequencing of Coalesce → Daybreak → Agonize maintained constant pressure while building value through advances. This is textbook resource optimization.

CRITICAL POSITION:
We're now in a very precarious position at 4/4 HP with only 1 trunk remaining, while opponent has 2/6 HP but 2 trunks. The weaken effect from Ritual was particularly impactful as it means any 2-damage spell will now cost us our last trunk.

The next round will be decisive - we need to either:
a) Find a way to deal 2 damage quickly before opponent can set up lethal
b) Protect ourselves while building resources for a multi-spell combination

This kind of tense endgame position showcases the depth of Elemental Elephants' strategic gameplay."
