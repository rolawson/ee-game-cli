# AI Architecture Plan for Elemental Elephants

## Overview
This document outlines a modular, extensible AI architecture for the Elemental Elephants card game that can be improved over time.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Strategy Pattern with Pluggable Components
- Create separate strategy classes for different aspects of gameplay
- Each strategy can be independently developed and tested
- Easy to add new strategies without modifying core code

### 2. Layered Decision Making
```
Game State Analysis → Strategy Selection → Move Evaluation → Action Execution
```

### 3. Key Components

#### Base AI Interface
- Abstract methods for decision points
- Configurable weights and parameters
- Performance metrics tracking

```python
class AIStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def evaluate_hand(self, player, game_state): pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def choose_card(self, player, game_state, valid_cards): pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def choose_target(self, player, game_state, valid_targets): pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def make_choice(self, player, game_state, options): pass
```

#### Strategy Modules
- **Aggressive Strategy**: Prioritize damage dealing and offensive spells
- **Defensive Strategy**: Focus on healing, protection, and survival
- **Combo Strategy**: Maximize spell synergies and response effects
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Counter opponent's play style
- **Economic Strategy**: Optimize resource management (hand/board control)

#### Game State Evaluator
- Board position scoring
- Threat assessment
- Resource management (hand size, health ratios)
- Opponent modeling
- Spell synergy detection

```python
class GameStateEvaluator:
    def evaluate_board_position(self, game_state, player): pass
    def calculate_threat_level(self, game_state, player): pass
    def score_hand_quality(self, hand, game_state): pass
    def predict_opponent_moves(self, opponent, game_state): pass
```

#### Decision Logger
- Track decisions and outcomes
- Enable machine learning improvements
- Performance analysis
- Strategy effectiveness metrics

### 4. Implementation Structure

```

```

### 5. Extensibility Points

#### New Spell Evaluation Algorithms
- Pluggable spell scoring functions
- Context-aware spell valuation
- Combo potential recognition

#### Pattern Recognition
- Opponent behavior tracking
- Play style classification
- Counter-strategy selection

#### Meta-Game Adaptation
- Track popular strategies
- Adjust weights based on success rates
- Evolve strategies over time

#### Difficulty Scaling
- **Easy**: Simple heuristics, predictable plays
- **Medium**: Basic strategy evaluation, some adaptation
- **Hard**: Full analysis, unpredictable, learns from player

### 6. Configuration System

```python
class AIConfig:
    # Personality traits (0.0 - 1.0)
    aggression: float = 0.5
    risk_tolerance: float = 0.5
    combo_preference: float = 0.5
    
    # Strategy weights
    damage_weight: float = 1.0
    healing_weight: float = 1.0
    board_control_weight: float = 1.0
    
    # Decision parameters
    lookahead_depth: int = 1
    randomness_factor: float = 0.1
```

### 7. Integration with Existing Code

The new AI system would replace the current `AI_Player` class with:

```python
class ModularAIPlayer:
    def __init__(self, strategy: AIStrategy, config: AIConfig):
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.config = config
        self.evaluator = GameStateEvaluator()
        self.logger = DecisionLogger()
    
    def choose_card_to_play(self, player, game_state):
        # Analyze game state
        evaluation = self.evaluator.evaluate_board_position(game_state, player)
        
        # Get valid cards
        valid_cards = self._get_valid_cards(player, game_state)
        
        # Use strategy to choose
        choice = self.strategy.choose_card(player, game_state, valid_cards)
        
        # Log decision
        self.logger.log_decision(choice, evaluation)
        
        return choice
```

### 8. Future Enhancements

#### Machine Learning Integration
- Train on logged decisions
- Reinforcement learning for strategy improvement
- Neural network for board evaluation

#### Tournament System
- AI vs AI battles for strategy testing
- Automatic parameter tuning
- Strategy evolution

#### Analytics Dashboard
