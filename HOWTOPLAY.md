# Elemental Elephants: Quick Start Guide

## Goal of the Game

Be the last player with any trunks remaining!

## Game Setup (First Round)

Each player does the following:

1. Get Components: Take 3 Trunks and a Health Dial. Set both your current health and your max health to 5.
2. Determine Ringleader: The player who makes the best elephant sound gets the Ringleader token. They will draft and play first.
3. Draft Your Spell Sets:
    - Starting with the Ringleader and going in turn order, each player chooses one Spell Set from the deck. A Spell Set is a group of cards featuring the same elephant character.
    - After every player has chosen one set, repeat the process. The Ringleader chooses a second set, followed by the other players in order. You will now have two sets.
4. Form Your Hand: Look at all the spells you just drafted. Choose 4 spells to be your starting hand. Place the rest in your personal discard pile.

## How to Play: A Round of 4 Clashes

A round is a series of 4 clashes. The play area is divided into four clash areas (using the clash mat or clash cards I-IV).

A single clash has 4 phases:

1. Prepare: In turn order, each player places one spell from their hand face-down into the current clash area.
2. Cast: Once all players have prepared a spell, everyone flips their spell face-up at the same time. These spells are now active.
3. Resolve: Spells activate in numerical order based on their Priority (the number in the top-right corner), from 1 to 5.
    If priorities are tied, the player earlier in the turn order resolves their spell first.
4. Advance: After all Priority 1-5 spells have resolved, any spells with the → icon activate. Resolve their 'Advance' instructions.

### Losing a Trunk

When your health reaches 0, you lose a trunk! Immediately after the current spell finishes resolving:

1. Destroy a Trunk: Move 1 of your Trunks to your discard pile.
2. Discard Spells on the Board: Discard all of your spells currently in the clash areas. You keep the cards in your hand.
3. Become Invulnerable: For the rest of this round, you cannot play spells and cannot be targeted. 
4. If only one player has health, the round ends immediately.

### End of the Round

1. Pass Ringleader: Pass the Ringleader token to the player on the left.
2. Clear the Board: All players discard their spells from the clash areas.
3. Manage Your Hand:
    - If your hand is empty, take one new Spell Set from the deck and add it to your hand.
    - If you have cards in your hand, you may choose to discard any of them.
4. Recall Spells: Recall (take cards and add them to your hand) until you reach your max hand size. You normally recall from your discard pile, but some spells let you recall from other places! Your maximum hand size is 4, plus 1 for each destroyed trunk.
