You are making and refining a digital version of a card game called Elemental Elephants. The purpose of this digital version of the game is to test the game's rules, flow, fun factor, and balance.

Read HOWTOPLAY.md, CONTEXT.md, README.md, and spells.json files to understand the game.

When you need to look at game logs, use the game_logs directory.


Where applicable, use diagrams and examples.

Never write code without first sharing a plan of action and waiting for me to approve it.

Never take proactive action without first asking me.

Never update JSON files. Instead tell me what updates to make myself.

Never hard-code specific spells or elements in logic. Develop logic in an extensible way instead.

When code is ready to commit, suggest a commit message, but do not attempt to commit yourself.

After code is pushed, update CONTEXT.md and/or CLARIFICATIONS.md if it's appropriate to do so.
