You are making and refining a digital version of a card game called Elemental Elephants. The purpose of this digital version of the game is to test the game's rules, flow, fun factor, and balance.

Read HOWTOPLAY.md, CONTEXT.md, README.md, and spells.json files to understand the game.

Where applicable, use diagrams and examples.

Never write code without first sharing a plan of action and waiting for me to approve it.

When code is ready to commit, suggest a commit message.

After code is pushed, update CONTEXT.md if it's appropriate to do so.
